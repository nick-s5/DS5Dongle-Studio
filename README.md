# DS5Dongle — Studio

## Enhanced UI fork

This fork adds an interactive, keyboard-accessible device manager to
[artzox/DS5Dongle-Studio](https://github.com/artzox/DS5Dongle-Studio).

- Independent L2/R2 tension editors with sliders and illustrative pull diagrams.
- Haptics mix and stick-response previews, with clearly grouped settings.
- Labeled switches, visible explanations, exact-value entry, and expandable advanced controls.
- Responsive macro and profile-slot cards, accessible control names, and keyboard focus that survives edits.

Settings use the existing firmware fields and explicit save commands. The previews
illustrate configuration rather than measuring physical motor response. Firmware
source and upstream release binaries are unchanged by this UI update.

The portal regression suite covers all 145 settings; browser checks cover keyboard
interaction and desktop/mobile layouts. Hardware behavior still needs validation
with a connected dongle. To run the regression suite: `sh tools/run-portal-tests.sh`
(requires Node.js and Python 3).

**Version 1.42.0**

▶️ **[Configure in your browser — enhanced UI](https://nick-s5.github.io/DS5Dongle-Studio/ds5-config-portal.html)** — the config portal can run as a web page, no download required. Needs Chrome or Edge, with the dongle plugged in.

💾 **[Downloads, source and releases on GitHub](https://github.com/artzox/DS5Dongle-Studio)** — the firmware `.uf2` files live under *Releases*.

📥 **[Shared game profiles](https://artzox.github.io/DS5Dongle-Studio/profiles.html)** · 🎮 **[Trigger effects](https://artzox.github.io/DS5Dongle-Studio/effects.html)** — ready-to-import per-game configs and adaptive-trigger effects captured from real games; download one and load it in the portal above.

A firmware modification for the [DS5Dongle](https://github.com/awalol/DS5Dongle)
(a Raspberry Pi Pico 2W-based wireless DualSense dongle) that adds **audio-derived
haptics** for games without native DualSense support, full **DS4Windows
compatibility**, **converted-rumble blending**, a **controller-speaker effect
leak** for added immersion, and **custom captured trigger effects** — record a
real adaptive-trigger effect from a game that has one and replay it in games that
don't — all configurable from a web-based portal.

> ⚠️ **Hardware requirement — an RP2350 board.** Two are supported:
>
> - **Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W** — the released `.uf2` is built for this board. Flash
>   it and you're done.
> - **Waveshare RP2350B-Plus-W** (USB-C, 16 MB flash, RM2 wireless) — a prebuilt
>   `ds5-v1.42.0-waveshare.uf2` now ships with each release; flash that and you're
>   done. It is built against pico-sdk 2.2.0, as this board requires.
>   *It has not yet been confirmed on hardware by anyone — if you have this board,
>   a report either way is very welcome.* To build it yourself instead, one command:
>
>   ```
>   Windows:  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\build-windows.ps1 -Variant waveshare
>   macOS:    ./tools/build-macos.sh --waveshare
>   ```
>
>   These fetch the right toolchain and SDK for you and write
>   `ds5-bridge-waveshare.uf2` into its own build directory. **This board needs
>   pico-sdk 2.2.0**, newer than the 2.1.1 used for the Pico 2 W build — and the
>   difference matters: against 2.1.1 this target still *compiles*, but the
>   resulting firmware does not work properly, because the RM2 wireless needs
>   2.2.0. If you build by hand with `boards/build_waveshare_rp2350b_plus_w.sh`,
>   it now checks your SDK version and refuses rather than handing you a
>   silently broken build.
>
> The original **Raspberry Pi Pico W** (RP2040) is **not** supported — it is a
> different chip (Cortex-M0+ vs Cortex-M33, less memory, no FPU), so a binary built
> for one cannot run on the other, and this firmware's floating-point audio DSP
> (auto-haptics, the effect leak, resampling) is designed around the RP2350's FPU
> and larger RAM. Check which board you have before flashing.

Built on **awalol/DS5Dongle v0.7.0**, which relocates the entire BT/USB/audio path
to RAM so native fine haptics and controller audio work without overclocking.

## What this adds over the base firmware

- **Audio-derived auto-haptics** — generates haptic feedback from game audio for
  titles that have no native DualSense haptics. Works over Bluetooth.
- **Remapping** — send a controller button, a mouse click or a scroll instead of
  a keystroke, hold it while the input is held, and hide the original from the
  game. Trigger-to-trigger remaps stay analog.
- **Motion gestures** — hold a button and flick your controller to fire a macro.
  Calibrated to your own movement when you record it.
- **Gyro as a mouse, with Flick Stick** — drive a mouse instead of the right
  stick for finer aim that never pegs, and flick the stick to snap the view to a
  bearing.
- **Two-stage triggers** — a second action past a point in the trigger's travel,
  so one pull gives you two signals with a detent you can feel between them.
- **Macros** — bind a controller button press/combo (`R3 + D-pad Up`) or a touchpad swipe to a
  keyboard combo, recorded by pressing the actual buttons and typing the actual
  keys. Up to 32, with tap-vs-hold and captured release order. Definitions are
  shared; which ones are live is per-profile, so Playnite switches macro sets per
  game.
- **Extensive DSP tuning** — intensity, smoothness, noise gate, crossover cutoff,
  and selectable filter slope (6/12/24 dB/oct) to get your auto-haptics as close as native as possible.
- **Three operating modes** — Off (native passthrough), Mix
  (native + derived), Replace (derived only)
- **DS4Windows compatibility** — auto-haptics keep working under DS4Windows in
  passthrough, DualShock 4, and Xbox 360 emulation modes (the base firmware's
  rumble handling silenced the haptic actuators; this fixes it).
- **Converted-rumble blending** — in Mix mode a game's rumble (whether from
  DS4Windows emulation or a native title sending motor values) is re-created on
  the actuators and blended with the audio haptics, with independent strength.
  The heavy and light motors are rendered at their own frequencies (60 Hz and
  160 Hz) and the rumble is injected after the limiter, so it keeps full
  authority instead of being squeezed out when the derived haptics are loud.
- **Effect leak** — instead of fully muting the controller speaker, optionally
  pass sharp transient effects (shots, clinks, impacts) through the speaker via
  transient detection, so discrete effects come through while sustained dialog and
  music stay muted — like native DualSense games.
- **Independent routing for every audio source** — "eat your cake and have it too"   for native dualsense games + auto-haptics mix mode. The derived haptics can be
  generated from either channel pair, the native passthrough can be filtered or
  passed raw, and the speaker and effect leak always stay on ch0/1. That makes
  it possible to run auto-haptics from the capture script while the controller
  speaker plays only the game's own native effects, or to add auto-haptics to a
  game that renders its own haptics without either one destroying the other.
- **Trigger-to-rumble (R2T)** — routes rumble into the trigger actuators as a
  tactile buzz, per trigger, with an "only while pressed" option, strength, and
  frequency. Useful for feeling rumble through the triggers in games that only
  send classic rumble.
- **Adaptive triggers (Stages 1 + 2)** — gated constant resistance for a light
  adaptive-trigger effect in games that don't drive the triggers themselves. R2
  and L2 are **fully independent**, each with its own mode, strength, threshold,
  start position and kick: gate a trigger by the opposite trigger (analog) or the
  opposite shoulder button (L1→R2, R1→L2, digital), or run it always-on. Stage 2
  adds a **push-back kick (recoil)**: while resistance is engaged, rumble/haptics
  bursts knock the trigger back against your finger — as a low-frequency vibration
  thump or a mechanical **bow-snap**, selectable per trigger — then resistance
  resumes.
- **Custom captured effects (new in 1.14.0)** — capture the *actual* adaptive-trigger
  effects a game sends (weapon walls, resistances, vibrations) and replay them on
  either trigger in games that have none. Effects are stored as the exact bytes the
  game sent — nothing is decoded into sliders, so the feel is the original one.
  Mechanical states are placed by the trigger positions encoded in their own bytes
  and played **in sequence as you pull** (e.g. wall → wall → end-resistance);
  vibrations can be captured **with their timing** and replayed to that rhythm.
  Effects can be saved and shared as JSON files.
- **Manual effect builder** — author trigger effects by hand when there is
  nothing to capture: stack weapon-break walls, bow snap-backs and vibrations,
  set their trigger zones and strengths, and the portal encodes them into the
  same bytes the firmware's own writers emit — so a hand-built effect is
  byte-identical to one a game would have sent. Built effects live alongside
  captured ones and save to the same JSON files.
- **Profile slots** — up to 32 complete configurations stored on the dongle
  itself. Save your setups once in the portal; switching later is a single
  instant command instead of a full profile write — used by the automation for
  per-game profiles (`Game = slot 3` in `profile-overrides.txt`), and applied
  atomically so a game launch can never leave the dongle half-configured.
- **Gyro-to-stick aiming** — maps controller motion onto the right stick for
  motion aiming, with selectable activation (always / while L2 held / touchpad
  touch / ratchet), sensitivity, horizontal axis source (yaw or roll), and
  per-axis invert.
- **Right-stick inversion** — invert the physical right stick's X axis, Y axis, or
  both, in any game with no PC-side software. Independent of gyro aiming (it applies
  whether or not gyro is on), for inverted-look setups or games that only offer
  inversion on one axis.
- **Native-haptics anti-alias** — optional smoothing on the native haptic stream
  (off / light / strong) to tame gritty high-frequency actuator noise.
- **Slot backup and restore** — download every stored profile slot, names
  included, as one JSON file and write them all back later. Protects hard-won
  tuning against a flash wipe or a bad flash.
- **Wake from sleep with no phantom controller** — see below; the bridge keeps
  a wakeable presence on USB while the controller is off, under a separate USB
  identity so nothing appears as a controller that is not there.
- **Lightbar control**, **live RSSI / signal display**, **reboot-to-bootloader**,
  and **experimental BT latency controls** (flush timeout, QoS).
- **Live diagnostics** — signal strength, battery, audio stream state and
  channel count, push-back envelope, the rumble a game is actually sending
  (peak-held, with the rumble flags it requested), and a wake report covering
  suspends, resumes, wake attempts and the current USB identity.
- **Sectioned web configuration portal** with smart save (only reconnects when a
  setting that requires re-enumeration changed).

The **Wake PC on PS Button** feature (USB remote wakeup) originates in the awalol
v0.7.0 base and is exposed here as a portal toggle, substantially reworked. It is
**off by default**; enable it only if you want the controller's PS button to wake
the PC from sleep.

With wake enabled the bridge **stays on the USB bus whenever the controller is
switched off** — it has to, or it could never tell that the PC went to sleep — but
it does so under a **separate USB identity**, so nothing appears as a controller
that is not there. The details, and what you will see in Windows, are in the callout
below.

> **Wake is a per-profile setting — on for auto-haptics games, off for native
> ones.** Enabling wake changes the controller's USB descriptor (it advertises USB
> 2.1 with a BOS descriptor and adds a keyboard interface, which the wake mechanism
> requires). The altered descriptor no longer looks like a "pure" DualSense, so
> **games with native DualSense support can stop recognising it** — a game such as
> *Ratchet & Clank* may fall back to Xbox-style rumble instead of native haptics,
> and the controller's speaker audio can stop working.
>
> Because wake is one of the settings that requires re-enumeration, a profile
> that switches it takes the dongle off USB for a second or two. Anything that
> talks to the dongle right afterwards has to wait for it to come back — the
> Playnite automation handles this, see `automation/AUTOMATION-README.md`.
>
> That only matters for games that use the controller natively. For **non-native
> games driven by an auto-haptics profile**, nothing is relying on native

>
> With wake **on**, the dongle stays present on USB even when the controller is
> switched off — it has to, or there would be nothing on the bus for the PC to
> suspend, and it could never tell the PC had slept. **This is what lets the PS
> button wake the PC even when you switched the controller off before putting the
> PC to sleep** — the usual case, and the one that fails outright if the dongle
> leaves the bus. In that state it appears under a **different USB identity** —
> different vendor and product IDs and its own name — so no controller shows up in
> DS4Windows or anywhere else; its normal identity returns when the controller
> reconnects.
>
> **What you will see while the controller is off.** Windows treats the idle
> identity as its own device, listed as **DS5Dongle (controller off)**. It is
> visible in `joy.cpl` (Game Controllers) and under **Settings → Bluetooth &
> devices → Devices**. This is expected and is not a phantom controller: it is
> the device the PC will be woken from. It also has its own *Allow this device to
> wake the computer* setting — usually granted automatically, and the portal's
> wake diagnostics will tell you if it was not.
>
> **First appearance switches your audio output.** Because the idle identity is a
> new device carrying the same audio interfaces, Windows discovers it as a fresh
> sound device and, by default, makes it the active output the first time it
> appears — so PC audio goes silent (or to the wrong endpoint) until you switch
> back. Set your normal output device again in the volume flyout or Sound
> settings; Windows remembers the choice, so this is a one-time correction rather
> than something that recurs.
>
> **DS4Windows does not pick it up, by design.** The idle identity does not match
> the controller IDs DS4Windows looks for, so it is not captured — which means
> DS4Windows stays free to auto-load profiles for any other controller you connect
> while the DualSense is off. If you would rather not see it at all, it can be
> hidden with **HidHide** like any other device, and it then disappears from games
> as well. Hiding it does not affect waking, which is handled by Windows at the USB
> level rather than by anything that reads the device.
>
> With wake **off** the dongle removes itself from USB entirely when the
> controller disconnects.
>
> `Wake PC on PS Button` is an ordinary configuration field, so every profile and

>
> - **auto-haptics profiles → wake on**
> - **native-game profiles → wake off**
>
> and the automation switches it per game along with everything else.
>
> One caveat about *how* the switch is applied. Changing wake forces a USB
> re-enumeration. **Slot activation** (`slot N` in `profile-overrides.txt`) sends a

> prefer slots for any profile that changes wake.

## Quick start

1. **Flash the firmware.** *(RP2350 only — Pico 2 W and Waveshare RP2350B-Plus-W
   each have their own prebuilt firmware, or build it yourself; this will not run
   on the original Pico W.)* Hold the BOOTSEL button while plugging in the board
   (or triple-click BOOTSEL on an already-running unit), then copy
   `ds5-v1.42.0.uf2` (Pico 2 W) or `ds5-v1.42.0-waveshare.uf2` (Waveshare) to the
   `RPI-RP2` drive that appears.
   - **You do not normally need `flash_nuke.uf2`** (the one supplied is built for
     the Pico 2 W). Settings and saved profile
     slots survive an upgrade — new options are appended to the stored layout, so
     old values keep their meaning and anything new lands on its default. Only
     run it if a release note explicitly says to, or if the portal shows settings
     that are clearly nonsense. **It erases every setting *and* all 32 profile
     slots**, so back up your slots first (*Slots* tab → *Back up all slots*).
2. **Open the portal.** **Download** `ds5-config-portal.html` and open the
   downloaded file in Chrome or Edge. (WebHID needs a secure context — opening it
   directly from a website host or `file://` that the browser flags will fail with
   a permissions error. Downloading it and opening the local file works, as does
   serving it from `http://localhost`.)
3. **Connect.** Click *Connect* and select the DualSense.
4. **Decide what you need — this determines whether there is anything left to do.**

   - **Playing games with native DualSense support?** Leave *Auto Haptics Mode* on
     **Off**, click *Save to Device*, and **you're finished.** Native games drive
     the controller's haptics themselves and the dongle passes them straight
     through — no Python, no helper, nothing else to install. **Native haptics also
     need two settings outside this project** — see
     [Native-haptics games — required setup](#native-haptics-games--required-setup).
   - **Want haptics in games *without* native support?** (Most games.) Set *Auto
     Haptics Mode* to **Mix** or **Replace**, tune to taste, *Save to Device* —
     then continue to step 5.

5. **Mix / Replace only — install and run the audio bridge.** Auto-haptics are
   *derived from your PC's game audio*, so a small helper has to capture that audio
   and feed it to the dongle. Windows only, since it uses WASAPI:

   1. **Install Python 3** from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) —
      tick **"Add python.exe to PATH"** in the installer.
   2. **Install its one dependency:**

      ```
      pip install PyAudioWPatch
      ```

   3. **Run it, and leave it running while you play:**

      ```
      python automation/ds5audio.py
      ```

   No device flags are needed for most setups — it finds the DualSense on its own
   (`--list`, `--in-index` and `--out-index` are there for when it picks wrong).

> **In Mix or Replace the audio bridge is not optional — and it is not part of the
> Playnite automation.** Without `ds5audio.py` running there is no audio for the
> firmware to derive from, so auto-haptics will appear to do nothing however they
> are tuned. That is the single most common reason auto-haptics "doesn't work". In
> **Off** (native) mode it isn't needed at all.

*(Not sure it's running? Since 1.18.25 the **Haptics** tab shows an "Audio bridge:
active / not detected" line right under the auto-haptics settings, plus two meters —
the audio arriving on the dongle against the haptic the DSP is deriving from it — so
you can watch "Haptics out" respond as you tune, and see at a glance whether audio
is reaching the dongle at all.)*

The firmware ships with safe stock defaults (auto-haptics off, standard buffer), so
a fresh flash is safe and native passthrough works immediately. For a tuned
auto-haptics + immersion setup, see **Suggested setup** below.

---

## Native-haptics games — required setup

Games with native DualSense support drive the controller themselves and the dongle
passes their haptics straight through. Whether that actually happens is decided by
two things outside this project, and both catch people out.

**1. Steam: set the controller override to *Disabled* for that game.**
Right-click the game in Steam → *Properties* → *Controller*, and set the override
to **Disabled**. Not *Default*, and not *Enabled* — either of those leaves Steam
Input in front of the controller, the game stops seeing a real DualSense, and
native haptics never arrive at all.

**2. DS4Windows may have to be closed.**
If you use DS4Windows to present an Xbox 360 or DS4 virtual pad, Steam can pick up
that virtual controller instead of the DualSense and refuse to treat the game as
native. Some titles need DS4Windows **closed entirely before launch** — *Doom: The
Dark Ages* is one. If a game that should have native haptics gives you nothing,
close DS4Windows and relaunch it before changing any other setting.

> You can stop the second problem happening at all by hiding the DualSense from
> everything except your native games, so the two worlds never collide. See
> **Mixing native DualSense and virtual controllers** in
> `automation/AUTOMATION-README.md`.

Also worth knowing for native games: keep **Wake PC on PS Button** *off* in those
profiles — see the wake note above for why.

## Suggested setup

These are good starting values for using auto-haptics with audio passthrough and
the effect leak, tuned on a real DualSense over Bluetooth. They are *suggestions* —
adjust to taste — but they give a working, balanced configuration without trial and
error. (The firmware does not ship with these as defaults, so there's no flashing
surprise; apply them in the portal and save.)

**Auto-Haptics & Speaker Effect Leak**

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Mode | Off (switch to Mix or Replace per game) |
| Intensity (%) | 80 Scales the DERIVED auto-haptics only. Native passthrough and converted rumble have their own levels (see ds5audio `--map` note) |
| Smoothness | 40 |
| Noise Gate | 20 |
| LP Cutoff (Hz) | 100 |
| Frequency Split Crossover (Hz) | 0 (off) |
| Low Band Gain | 100 |
| High Band Gain | 100 |
| Filter Slope | 12 dB/oct |
| Auto-mute Speaker (Replace) | Yes |
| Auto-mute Speaker (Mix) | Yes |
| Converted Rumble Strength (Mix) | 50 (range goes to 200; left/heavy renders at 60 Hz, right/light at 160 Hz) |
| Effect Leak Volume (0=off) | 0 (raise to enable) |
| Effect Leak Sensitivity | 50 |
| Effect Leak Decay/Fade-out | 80 |
| Effect Leak Attack/Responsiveness | 50 |
| Effect Leak Output High-pass (Hz) | 1000 |
| Effect Leak Output Low-pass (Hz) | 8000 |
| Effect Leak Gate Hold (x5 ms) | 20 |
| Effect Leak Max Burst (x5 ms) | 0 (off; try 30) |
| Effect Leak Detection Band (Hz) | 2500 |

**General Haptics & Audio**

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Native Haptics Gain | 1.00 |
| Speaker Volume | 100 |
| Headset Volume | 100 |
| Speaker Gain | 2 |
| Sync Speaker & Headset Volume | Yes |
| Lock Volume | No |
| Disable Mic | No |
| Disable Speaker | No |

**Device & Connection**

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Polling Rate | Real-time |
| Audio Buffer Length | 16 |
| Inactive Time (min) | 12 |
| Disable Inactive Disconnect | No |
| Disable Pico LED | No |
| Wake PC on PS Button | On for auto-haptics profiles, off for native games |

**Advanced — BT Latency (experimental)**

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| BT Flush Timeout | Off (reliable) |
| BT QoS Latency | Off |

Notes on the suggested values:
- **Mode is set per game.** Leave it Off for games with good native DualSense
  haptics (full fidelity). Use **Replace** for games with no native haptics, or
  **Mix** for non-native games where you also want converted controller rumble.
- **Effect Leak Volume starts at 0 (off).** Raise it (e.g. 20–30) to enable the
  effect leak. With it on, **Audio Buffer Length 16** keeps latency low; the
  transient-detection leak no longer requires a deep buffer.
- **Detection Band 2500 Hz + Output High-pass 1000 Hz** make the leak selective to
  sharp effects and protect the small controller speaker from low-frequency popping.
- **Decay 80** gives effects a gradual, natural fade-out rather than an abrupt cut.

## Configuration reference

The portal groups settings into the sections below.

### Auto-Haptics & Speaker Effect Leak

| Setting | Range | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mode | Off / Mix / Replace | Off | Off = native/rumble passthrough; Mix = native + derived; Replace = derived only |
| Intensity (%) | 0–200 | 100 | Strength of the audio-derived haptics only (curved response). It does NOT scale the native passthrough or converted rumble — those have their own levels, so the three components are set independently |
| Smoothness | 0–100 | 40 | Higher = smoother/longer decay; lower = snappier |
| Noise Gate | 0–100 | 20 | Suppresses quiet content (dialog/ambience) below a threshold |
| Native Passthrough in Mix (%) | 0–100 | 100 | MIX MODE ONLY: level of the native ch3/4 haptic stream mixed under the derived haptics. See "Choosing the passthrough level" below |
| Filter Native Passthrough in Mix | Filtered / Raw | Filtered | MIX MODE ONLY: whether the ch3/4 passthrough is low-passed at the LP Cutoff before mixing. See "Filtered or Raw?" below |
| Auto-Haptics DSP Source | ch0/1 / ch2/3 | ch0/1 | Which channel pair the derived haptics are generated from. The speaker and effect leak always read ch0/1. See "Separating the script feed from game audio" below |
| LP Cutoff (Hz) | 30–200 | 60 | Upper edge of the haptics band — only audio **below** this drives haptics (content above never reaches the actuators) |
| Frequency Split Crossover (Hz) | 0 / 30–200 | 0 (off) | Divides the haptics band in two at this frequency; 0 = single-band (identical to pre-split firmware). Must sit **below** LP Cutoff |
| Low Band Gain | 0–100 | 100 | Contribution of content **below** the crossover (impacts, explosions, engine weight) |
| High Band Gain | 0–100 | 100 | Contribution of the crossover..cutoff range (music bass, voice fundamentals) — lower it to tame music/dialog-driven buzz |
| Filter Slope | 6 / 12 / 24 dB/oct | 12 | Steeper rejects voice above the cutoff more aggressively |

#### Choosing the passthrough level (Native Passthrough in Mix)

In **Mix** mode the actuators receive three components: the **native ch3/4
stream** (scaled by this fader), the **derived** auto-haptics (scaled by
Intensity, shaped by the frequency split and gate), and **converted rumble**
(its own strength knob). The fader exists because ch3/4 mean different things in
different setups:

| Scenario | Mode | Set passthrough to | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Native game, passthrough profile | Off | (ignored) | With auto-haptics Off, ch3/4 always pass at full — the game's own HD haptics. The fader has no effect in Off |
| Native game + auto-haptics on top | Mix | **100** | Classic Mix: the game's real haptics plus derived augmentation |
| Non-native game (DS4Windows / XB360 / DS4) | Mix | **0** (or taste) | ds5audio's default `duplicate` mapping copies the game audio onto ch3/4 — an uncontrollable shadow of the derived haptics. At 0, Intensity/split/gate control the whole output; game rumble stays on Converted Rumble Strength. With the fader at 0 the ds5audio `--map` choice no longer matters in Mix |
| Any game | Replace | (ignored) | Replace discards ch3/4 by definition — derived only |

Rule of thumb: **the fader answers "is there anything REAL on ch3/4?"** Native
game = yes, keep 100. Non-native = no (it's a duplicate), set 0.

#### Filtered or Raw? (Filter Native Passthrough in Mix)

The passthrough has always been low-passed at the LP Cutoff before mixing. That
is right for a **duplicate** feed — in ds5audio's default mapping (and in
VoiceMeeter-style routings) ch3/4 carry a copy of the full-band stereo, and
passing that raw sends dialogue and treble straight to the actuators. It is
wrong for a game that renders its **own** haptics, because real haptic content
lives well above a typical 80 Hz cutoff: filtering removes exactly the effects
the passthrough exists to carry, and no amount of passthrough level brings them
back.

| Your ch3/4 carries | Set to | Why |
|---|---|---|
| A game's own native haptics | **Raw** | Keeps the game's effects intact. Pair with `--map front` so the script does not also write to ch3/4 |
| A duplicate of the game audio (default `--map duplicate`) | **Filtered** | Blocks dialogue/treble leaking to the actuators. Usually better still: set passthrough level to 0 |
| The script feed, because DSP Source is ch2/3 | **Filtered** (or level 0) | ch3/4 is raw captured audio here, not haptics — see below |

The derived haptics are always filtered by the LP Cutoff, split and gate
regardless of this setting; it applies only to the passthrough component.

#### Separating the script feed from game audio (Auto-Haptics DSP Source)

The speaker and the effect leak always read **ch0/1**. With the default DSP
source that pair must also carry the script feed the derived haptics are
generated from — so anything ds5audio sends is also what the speaker plays and
what the leak passes. For a game that outputs **its own audio effects through
the controller speaker** (Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is the obvious example,
with its weapon and gadget sounds sent to the pad), that means the game's
speaker effects arrive mixed with the whole captured PC soundtrack, and there
is no way to hear only the former.

Setting DSP Source to **ch2/3** breaks that coupling:

```
ds5audio.py --map rear      # script capture -> ch2/3 only, ch0/1 left clear
```

| Component | Reads | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Derived auto-haptics | ch2/3 | Generated from the script feed, as before |
| Controller speaker | ch0/1 | Only the game's own native speaker audio |
| Effect leak | ch0/1 | Only the game's native effects pass through |

Set **Native Passthrough to 0** in this configuration: ch3/4 now carries raw
script audio rather than native haptics. On a 2-channel stream the DSP falls
back to ch0/1 automatically.

#### Which setup for which game

| Game type | ds5audio `--map` | Mode | DSP Source | Passthrough | Filter | Rumble |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Native haptics (e.g. Returnal, Ragnarök) | `front` | Mix | ch0/1 | 100 | **Raw** | as taste |
| Native speaker audio you want isolated (e.g. Ratchet & Clank) | `rear` | Mix | **ch2/3** | 0 | (n/a) | as taste |
| Non-native, DS4Windows / XB360 | `duplicate` | Mix | ch0/1 | 0 | (n/a at 0) | 50–100 |
| Native haptics, no augmentation wanted | any | Off | — | (full) | (n/a) | (native) |

Every one of these is an ordinary configuration field, so each row can live in
its own dongle slot and be selected per game — but note the `--map` value is a
ds5audio argument, not a dongle setting, so profiles that need a different
mapping also need the matching launch argument. With the optional Playnite
automation this is handled per game in `profile-overrides.txt`, which passes
anything after a further comma to the capture script:

```
Resident Evil 4 = slot 5, audio, --map front
Ratchet = slot 6, audio, --map rear
```

A game listed in `native-games.txt` needs the explicit `, audio` shown above,
or the capture is skipped — the native list excludes exactly those games by
default. See `automation/AUTOMATION-README.md`.

#### Is the game even sending rumble? (Diagnostics)

The Device tab reports **Rumble from host** — the peak motor values seen since
the last read, plus which rumble flags the game requested. Non-zero while a
game vibrates means it sends motor values, which Mix re-creates through
Converted Rumble Strength. Zeros while you can still feel vibration with
auto-haptics Off mean the game delivers its vibration as haptic audio on ch3/4
instead, which is the passthrough's job — set the filter to **Raw**. The values
are peak-held, so a short burst between polls still registers.

Continuing the **Auto-Haptics & Speaker Effect Leak** settings:

| Setting | Range | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Auto-mute Speaker (Replace) | on/off | on | Mute controller speaker in Replace mode |
| Auto-mute Speaker (Mix) | on/off | off | Mute controller speaker in Mix mode |
| Converted Rumble Strength (Mix) | 0–200 | 50 | Strength of a game's rumble re-created on the actuators in Mix mode. Left/heavy renders at 60 Hz, right/light at 160 Hz. Above 100 deliberately overdrives into the limiter for games whose motor values sit low |
| Effect Leak Volume | 0–100 | 0 (off) | Volume of the transient effect leak through the speaker when auto-muted |
| Effect Leak Sensitivity | 0–100 | 50 | How sudden a level jump counts as an effect (higher = more leaks through) |
| Effect Leak Decay/Fade-out | 0–100 | 40 | How gradually effects fade after triggering (~50 ms .. 500 ms) |
| Effect Leak Attack/Responsiveness | 0–100 | 50 | How fast the gate opens (higher = more immediate, less delay) |
| Effect Leak Output High-pass (Hz) | 50–2000 | 200 | Low wall of the leak window (12 dB/oct) — removes deep bass that pops the speaker |
| Effect Leak Output Low-pass (Hz) | 500–12000 | 8000 | High wall of the leak window (12 dB/oct) — cuts treble sizzle/crackle. With the high-pass forms a band-pass "capture window": only sound inside it leaks. Automatic make-up gain keeps loudness constant as you move the walls |
| Effect Leak Gate Hold (×5 ms) | 0–100 | 20 (100 ms) | Minimum gate-open time per transient + hysteresis; stops the gate chattering (the "choppy/poppy" leak artifact) |
| Effect Leak Max Burst (×5 ms) | 0–100 | 0 (off) | MAXIMUM gate-open time: cuts sustained sounds (dialogue, music) at the cap with a no-retrigger refractory — one short accent instead of duplicating the room audio; shots end within the cap naturally. Try 30 (150 ms) and raise leak volume: the leak becomes punctuation, not a second speaker |
| Effect Leak Detection Band (Hz) | 100–5000 | 800 | Frequency band the transient detector listens to |

#### Browser audio bridge — test mode *(new in 1.28.0)*

> **This is a test mode, not a replacement for `ds5audio.py`.** It exists so
> someone can try auto-haptics without installing Python. It cannot be automated,
> and it does not do everything the script does — see the limits below before
> deciding which to use.

Auto-haptics are derived from your PC's audio, so something has to capture what is
playing and send it to the dongle. Normally that is `ds5audio.py`. The **Browser
audio bridge** on the Haptics tab does the same job from the page itself.

**Nothing leaves your machine.** The captured audio is routed inside the browser
straight back out to the dongle's audio input. There is no server, no upload, and
nothing is recorded — the screen share is how Chrome exposes system audio, and the
video is discarded the moment capture starts.

**It only works from the live page.** Open
[the hosted portal](https://artzox.github.io/DS5Dongle-Studio/ds5-config-portal.html).
A copy saved to disk has no persistent origin, so the browser grants audio
permission for a single call, forgets it immediately, and never reveals any output
devices — the list simply stays empty. Everything *else* in the portal works fine
from a local file; only this needs a real address.

Setting it up:

1. Open the **Haptics** tab and scroll down to **Browser audio bridge**.
2. Press **List output devices**, and allow the microphone when asked. That
   permission is only what makes Chrome willing to *name* audio devices; the
   microphone itself is released straight away.
3. Choose the dongle as the output — it appears as **Speakers (DualSense)**,
   **Speakers (DualSense Edge)** or similar, depending on which controller is
   paired. It is preselected when the name is recognised, but check it: sending
   to your PC speakers instead is silent at the dongle and looks like a failure.
4. **Load the slot you want first**, before starting the bridge — see the warning
   below.
5. Press **Start bridging**, and in Chrome's dialog pick **Entire Screen**. System
   audio is not offered for a single window or tab.
6. **Tick "Share system audio".** It is *not* on by default, and without it the
   capture is silent — this is the single most common reason nothing happens.

Watch the line under the buttons: it reads the dongle's own signal level, so a
non-zero peak means audio is genuinely arriving at the device rather than merely
leaving the browser.

> **Playing borderless?** Chrome's "you are sharing your screen" bar stays on top
> of a borderless window. Click **Hide** on it once and it gets out of the way.

> **Set the profile before you start bridging.** Switching slots while the bridge
> is running can produce a howling feedback effect. A slot change can re-enumerate
> the USB device, which takes the audio endpoint away and brings it back underneath
> a capture that is still running — and for the moment the routing is in flux the
> output can find its way back into the capture. Stop the bridge, switch, and start
> it again.

What it does **not** do, all of which the script does:

| | Script | Browser bridge |
|---|---|---|
| Starts automatically with a game (Playnite) | yes | **no** — the share dialog cannot be automated |
| Runs unattended, no window | yes | **no** — the tab must stay open |
| `--map rear` / ch2/3 DSP source | yes | **no** — the browser feed is stereo, ch0/1 only |
| Native passthrough on ch2/3 | yes | **no** |
| Works on a locally saved portal | n/a | **no** — hosted page only |
| Browser and OS | Windows | **Chrome on Windows** — see below |

**Not available on Linux or macOS.** Capturing system audio through the browser is
a Chrome feature on Windows and ChromeOS only — elsewhere the share dialog offers
no "Share system audio" option at all, so there is nothing to route. The same is
true of `ds5audio.py`, which uses WASAPI and is Windows-only for the same reason,
so on Linux there is currently no route to **derived** auto-haptics from either.

Worth separating, though: **native** haptics do work on Linux. A game or desktop
that sends the DualSense's own 4-channel haptic stream reaches the dongle
normally, and the trigger effects, gyro, macros and profile slots are all
unaffected — they never involved audio capture. It is only the
audio-derived haptics that need a capture tool neither route provides.

If you want per-game profiles switching themselves as you launch, use the script.
If you want to feel what auto-haptics does before installing anything, use this.

#### How auto-haptics works (brief)

The DualSense haptic actuator is a voice coil that cannot render a near-DC signal,
so a naive low-pass of the audio produces no motion. This firmware instead uses the
bass **envelope** of the game audio to amplitude-modulate a 90 Hz carrier that sits
in the actuator's responsive band — turning "how much bass" into felt rumble. A
noise gate and a steep, configurable low-pass keep dialog and music from triggering
the haptics. Under DS4Windows, the firmware keeps the controller in actuator mode
(rather than letting rumble reports force it into motor mode) so the derived
haptics keep playing.

The **effect leak** uses transient detection: it tracks fast and slow envelopes of
the high-frequency content and opens the speaker only when the level jumps sharply
(an onset), so discrete impacts pass while sustained sound stays muted. The output
is high-passed to protect the small speaker from low-frequency popping.

### Native Haptics Filter

Applies only to **native** haptics — the signal a game with real DualSense support
sends. It does nothing to derived auto-haptics.

| Setting | Range | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Smoothing (anti-alias filter) | Off / Light / Strong | Light | Off = raw and gritty (the pre-1.0.4 texture); Light removes the grit while keeping transient snap; Strong is smoothest but can feel muted |

*Guide:* leave this on **Light**. Reach for **Off** only if you want the older,
harsher texture back, and **Strong** if a particular game's native haptics sound
buzzy or harsh on your pad.

### General Haptics & Audio

| Setting | Range | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Native Haptics Gain | 1.0–2.0 | 1.0 | Multiplier on native haptic channels |
| Speaker Volume | 0–127 | 100 | Controller speaker volume (also scales haptic strength) |
| Headset Volume | 0–127 | 100 | Headset jack volume |
| Speaker Gain | 0–7 | 2 | Controller speaker gain stage |
| Sync Speaker & Headset Volume | on/off | on | Tie the two volumes together |
| Lock Volume | on/off | off | Ignore in-game volume changes |
| Disable Mic | on/off | off | Disable the controller microphone |
| Disable Speaker | on/off | off | Disable the controller speaker |

### Trigger strength reduction *(new in 1.42.0)*

Weakens the adaptive-trigger motors, in ten steps. It is set on the **Triggers**
tab, in the *Trigger Strength* section.

| Setting | Range | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Trigger strength reduction | Off, 1–10 | Off | Off is full strength; 10 is the weakest |

The reduction happens **inside the controller**: the dongle asks the DualSense to
lower its trigger motor power, rather than reshaping the effects it sends. So an
effect keeps its shape — where a wall sits, where a bow snaps, how a weapon
breaks — and only its force drops.

Because of that, it applies to **everything** driving the triggers:

- a game's own native trigger effects, which is where it is most useful — for
  games whose resistance is heavier than you want;
- this fork's own adaptive trigger settings and custom effects.

It is independent of *Force Override*: the reduction applies whether the game or
the dongle owns the triggers at the time.

Like any new setting, it is only kept in a slot once that slot has been saved on
a version that has it. Ported from awalol's DS5Dongle 0.72 (`trigger_reduce`).

### Trigger-to-Rumble (R2T)
Routes the rumble signal into the trigger actuators as a buzz.

| Setting | Range | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| R2T Mode | Off / Left / Right / Both | Off | Which trigger(s) buzz from rumble |
| Only vibrate when trigger pressed | on/off | off | on = buzz only when the trigger is pulled past ~25%; off = buzz whenever there's rumble |
| Strength | 0–100 | 100 | Amplitude multiplier on the rumble value |
| Frequency | 1–255 | 60 | Buzz frequency of the trigger effect (higher = finer/tighter buzz) |

*Guide:* enable **Both** with **Only While Pressed = on** for a subtle "feel the
rumble in your triggers only when you're using them" effect. With **off**, the
triggers buzz continuously whenever the game sends rumble. If a game drives its own
trigger effects, R2T yields to it by default (see *Force Override* below).

### Adaptive Triggers (Stage 1: resistance, Stage 2: push-back kick)
L2-gated constant resistance on R2 — hold the aim trigger and R2 stiffens. On top
of that, the push-back kick delivers recoil: while resistance is engaged, each
rumble/haptics burst momentarily switches the kicking trigger(s) to a low-frequency vibration thump (or a Bow-effect snap, see Kick style)
that knocks the trigger back against your finger, then resistance resumes as the
burst fades (hysteresis prevents chatter at the threshold).

R2 and L2 are shown side by side in the portal, as two aligned columns of the
same settings — the list below applies to each. The one exception is **Kick
follows** (the kick's envelope source): it is a single signal both triggers
listen to, so it sits in its own full-width row beneath the columns rather than
in either one.

| Setting (per trigger) | Range | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mode | Off / Gated by trigger / Always / Gated by shoulder | Off | "Gated by trigger" = the OPPOSITE trigger arms it, analog (L2 arms R2, R2 arms L2). "Gated by shoulder" = the opposite bumper arms it, digital (L1→R2, R1→L2). Any R2/L2 combination is valid |
| Resistance strength | 0–100 | 70 | Resistance intensity (mapped to the effect's 0–7 range) |
| Arming threshold | 1–255 | 30 | In "Gated by trigger" mode, how far the arming trigger must be pulled (~12% at default). Ignored in shoulder-gated mode (digital on/off) |
| Resistance start position | 0–9 | 0 | Trigger-travel zone where resistance begins (0 = from the start) |
| Resistance shape | Constant / Ramp / Two-stage / Weapon break | Constant | Constant = flat Strength A. **Ramp** = linear A→B across the pull (racing: light→heavy gas, heavy→light brake). **Two-stage detent** = Strength A with a wall of Strength B at the detent zone — a tactile bump marking half-press from full-press (fire/alt-fire games). **Weapon break** = rigid wall then hardware snap-through at the break point — the semi-auto shot break (Strength B unused) |
| Strength B | 0–100 | 70 | Second strength: the ramp's end value, or the detent wall |
| — Strength 0 in shapes | | | In Ramp/Two-stage, a strength of 0 means genuinely FREE travel (zone excluded): Ramp A=0 = free at rest building to B; Detent A=0 = a pure bump with free travel around it |
| Detent zone / break point | 0–9 | 5 | Two-stage: the wall's zone. Weapon break: the snap-through point (hw 3–8, forced above start) |
| Activation dead zone | 0–9 | 0 (off) | Below this zone the GAME sees the trigger untouched (no analog, no press bit) — the shot registers only past the zone. Aligns hair-trigger games with the resistance/detent/bow feel; internal effects always see the raw trigger. Not for analog gas/brake inputs |
| Push-back kick strength | 0–100 | 0 (off) | Recoil intensity; scales the thump amplitude with the vibration envelope. 0 = no kick on that trigger (pure resistance) |
| Kick style | Thump / Bow snap | Thump | Thump = vibration buzz (0x26). Bow snap = mechanical push-back via the Bow effect (0x22): the snap force presses the trigger back against the finger — sharper recoil, experimental (feel varies with hold depth) |
| Kick thump frequency | 10–200 | 35 | Vibration frequency of the kick; lower = heavier knock, higher = buzzier (R2T's default buzz is 60 for comparison) |

| Shared setting | Range | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Kick follows | Rumble / Audio / Both | Both | Envelope source for **both** triggers' kicks: game rumble (incl. converted DS4Windows rumble), the auto-haptics audio envelope, or the strongest of the two. **Unless the trigger is gated, prefer *Rumble* only** — otherwise the generated haptics keep the audio envelope alive and the trigger moves almost constantly |

*Guide:* **L2-gated** gives a shooter-style "aim to feel the trigger tension"
effect without needing native adaptive-trigger support. Resistance wins over R2T
vibration while engaged, so you can run **R2T Both + AT L2-gated** together: the
triggers buzz with rumble normally, and R2 stiffens the moment you aim. For
recoil, start around **kick 60–80, frequency 35, source Both**: aim, fire, and
each shot thumps R2. *Audio* as a source means even games with zero rumble kick
on gunfire via the auto-haptics envelope. The diagnostics box shows the live
**push-back envelope (0–255)** and a **KICK** flag — the kick fires at envelope
≥ 32, so if the number stays 0 while the game rumbles, the selected source isn't
producing signal.

### Two-stage triggers *(new in 1.22.0)*

A second action part-way through the trigger's travel. Pull to the boundary and
the game sees the trigger as normal; push past it and a button press is added.
Pair it with a **weapon-break** effect and the wall you feel *is* the boundary,
so the second stage lands at a point your finger can find.

| Setting | Range | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Two-stage trigger | Off / Add / Add + rescale / Swap / Swap + rescale | Off | *Add* keeps the trigger held past the boundary; *Swap* releases it so only the button remains |
| Second-stage boundary | 0–254 | 0 (off) | Trigger position where the second stage engages |
| Second-stage button | any face, shoulder, stick or trigger button | None | What the second stage presses |

**Add** suits anything where the trigger must stay held — a racing throttle that
also engages a boost. **Swap** suits a soft-press / hard-press split where the two
actions are alternatives rather than layers.

**Rescale** stretches the travel below the boundary over the full range, so the
shortened first stage keeps its full analog resolution instead of being clipped.

The second stage can press **the other trigger** — R2 can drive L2 and vice
versa. That moves the analog axis, not just the digital bit, since games read the
triggers as axes. A trigger is never offered as its own second-stage button.

If the button you pick is also what gates that trigger's resistance, the portal
warns: pressing through the detent would open the gate arming the resistance you
are pressing against, changing the feel under the finger making the press.

There is hysteresis on the boundary, so holding at exactly the crossing point
gives one press rather than a stream of them.

### Custom Captured Effects (new in 1.14.0)

Capture a real adaptive-trigger effect from a game that has one, and replay it on
any trigger in a game that doesn't. Effects are stored as the exact 11-byte
commands the game sent — they are **not** decoded into the sliders above (a game's
force curves don't survive that round-trip), so what you feel is the original
effect, not an approximation.

**See what an effect looks like.** Every effect — whether you build it, load it, or
read it back off a trigger — is drawn as a diagram in the portal: trigger travel
along the bottom, force up the side, with resistance shown as per-zone steps, a
weapon-break wall marking where it gives way, a bow's ramp and snap point, and
vibration as a band over the part of the pull where it plays. Sequenced stages show
their hand-off points, and a wall or bow the sequencer cuts short before it fires is
faded and marked ✕ — so a truncated effect is obvious at a glance. Since a trigger
effect can't really be conveyed in words, the diagram can be screenshotted and
shared. *(New in 1.18.25.)*

**What can and can't be captured**

- ✅ **Genuine game-sent adaptive-trigger effects** — games with native DualSense
  trigger support (*Ratchet & Clank*, *God of War Ragnarök*, *Returnal*,
  *Indiana Jones*…).
- ❌ **Firmware-converted rumble.** For example *Control*'s trigger buzz is this
  firmware's own R2T conversion of the game's rumble, not a trigger effect the game
  sent — there is nothing to capture.
- ❌ **DS4Windows / Xbox 360 emulated rumble** — same reason.

If the monitor stays empty after you perform the action in-game, that game isn't
sending trigger effects.

**1. Capture — Trigger Effect Monitor**

1. In the game, perform the trigger action (pull the weapon trigger, hold the
   spear…).
2. Alt-tab to the portal → **Triggers** tab → **Trigger Effect Monitor** → **Refresh captured
   effects**.
3. The last few *distinct* effects each trigger received are listed, labelled by
   type (Resistance / Weapon break / Vibration) with their raw bytes.
4. Tick the states that make up the action (up to 5) → **Assign ticked → custom
   effect**.

Enable and state count are set for you; **state count is never set by hand**.

**2. How this differs from the trigger sliders above**

The two systems work on completely different principles, which is why they are
mutually exclusive on a trigger:

| | Trigger sliders (Adaptive Triggers) | Custom captured effects |
|---|---|---|
| Where the effect comes from | **Synthesised** from your parameters (strength, shape, start position, detent) | **Replayed** from stored raw effect bytes |
| How many effects | **One**, continuously recomposed | **Up to 5 states**, one active at a time |
| What changes the feel | Game **rumble** and **audio** (kick, R2T, auto-haptics) plus trigger position | **Trigger position only** |
| Editable | Yes — every parameter is a slider | No — the bytes are fixed (but you can build new ones) |
| Multi-stage pulls | Not possible (one effect slot; the detent gives one bump, not a second wall) | Yes — that is the point |

The sliders are a *live synthesiser*: they rebuild one effect every cycle in
response to what the game is doing, which is why they can react to rumble and
audio. Custom effects are a *player*: the states are fixed, and the only thing
that decides which one is active is where your finger is on the trigger. Neither
can do the other's job — the sliders can't stage two walls in one pull, and a
captured effect can't respond to a game explosion.

**3. How assigned effects replay** — the mode is chosen automatically by type:

- **Mechanical states (Resistance, Weapon break, Bow/snap) → positional sequencing.** States
  are ordered by the trigger positions encoded in their own bytes and played in
  sequence as you pull, each stage arming just before your finger reaches it. Tick
  order doesn't matter. This reproduces a full action such as *Ratchet & Clank*'s
  wall at ~30% → wall at ~50% → light end-resistance in the rapid-fire hold.
- **Vibration states → time-based.** A 2-state pair blends A↔B at the toggle rate;
  a timeline recording (below) replays the recorded rhythm instead.

**How far each stage runs.** A stage hands over to the next one shortly *before*
the next stage's region begins, so the next effect is always armed ahead of your
finger rather than snapping into place under it. The consequence is worth knowing
when you design a sequence:

- **Stages that don't overlap** — e.g. zones 1-3, then 4-7, then 8-9 — each play
  their **whole span**, including the last. Any clean gap between one stage's end
  and the next stage's start is enough.
- **Stages that overlap** — e.g. zones 1-3, then 2-4 — are **cut short**, because
  the hand-over point falls inside the earlier stage. A bow whose draw is cut
  before its end never reaches its snap, which softens the ending. That can be
  exactly what you want, but it is easy to hit by accident: the builder warns
  whenever a stage ends up with less than 40 of the trigger's 255 counts.

So there are three distinct replay behaviours, picked for you:

1. **One state** — asserted continuously while the condition holds.
2. **Mechanical sequence** (2–5 states, at least one force effect — wall,
   resistance or bow) — ordered
   by trigger position and stepped through as you pull. Recorded durations are
   ignored; position is the only clock. A vibration may be mixed in as one of the
   stages, and it takes over at its own depth.
3. **Vibration pair or timeline** (all states are vibrations) — driven by *time*,
   either the A↔B toggle rate or the recorded per-state durations.

> **A multi-stage effect only sequences under the *While held* condition.** Stages
> are stepped through by trigger position, which needs the effect armed for the
> whole pull. Set that trigger to *On press* or *On release* and you get a single
> one-shot of the first stage instead — the later stages simply never play, with
> no error to tell you why. Assigning from the **builder** therefore sets the
> condition to *While held* (and the zone to 0) for you; assigning from the
> monitor, a timeline or a file leaves the condition as you have it, so check it
> if you are building a sequence that way.

**4. Timeline recording — for vibration rhythm**

The monitor's history carries no timing. When a vibration's character *is* its
rhythm (switch-then-hold, pulse patterns), use **Timeline recording** (Triggers
tab, under the effect monitor): press
**● Record**, perform the action in-game, then **Stop & fetch**. Every state change
is listed with the milliseconds it was held; tick the loopable core (up to 5) and
**Assign ticked timeline**. Replay holds each state for its recorded duration and
loops — no rate dialling needed.

Durations are **ignored for mechanical states** (a wall's recorded duration is just
how long you happened to hold it, not part of the effect), so walls and resistances
always sequence positionally even if you assign them from a timeline or load a file
that contains durations.

**5. Getting a custom VIBRATION to work**

This is where the **trigger condition** matters:

- **The reliable recipe is a one-shot: condition On press or On release, with a
  zone.** Set the zone to where in the pull you want it — e.g. **zone 9** gives a
  late-stage kick right at the bottom of the travel, zone 2–3 fires it early. The
  **zone must not be 0** (see below). In practice this does not feel like a brief
  blip: once the trigger is past the zone the buzz continues until you physically
  release it, so "On press + zone 9" gives a **buzz through the deep part of the
  pull** — which is usually what you want from a captured vibration.
- **Sustained hold** (e.g. the *God of War Ragnarök* spear): condition **While
  held**, assigning the sustained state **alone** — don't assign the whole
  timeline, because its long duration is only how long you held the trigger while
  recording. Note that a vibration does not keep buzzing from a single command;
  the firmware re-sends it periodically to sustain it. If a held vibration feels
  weak or intermittent, use a one-shot condition instead.
- **Firing kick or release pop**: condition **On press** or **On release**, and the
  **zone must not be 0**. In those modes the zone is the *engage point* and the
  effect fires as a short one-shot when the trigger crosses it — at zone 0 the
  trigger is always already "past" the point, so the crossing never happens and
  **nothing will ever fire**. Use zone 1–9 (roughly 10–90% of the pull).
- A vibration asserted while the trigger is held **at full travel** can buzz
  mechanically (a fully depressed trigger resonates against the controller body).
  This is another reason to prefer a one-shot condition over a sustained
  full-pull buzz.
- A vibration's own zone bytes do **not** restrict where it buzzes — the effect
  runs whenever it is active, regardless of trigger position. Position control
  comes from the **zone + condition** settings, or from placing the vibration as a
  stage in a built multi-stage effect (below).

**Settings (per trigger)**

| Setting | Range | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Custom captured effect — enable | Off / On | Off | On = the custom effect **owns** this trigger's effect output (see below) |
| Custom effect trigger condition | While held / On press / On release | While held | *While held* = armed continuously — **required for a multi-stage effect to sequence**, and used for a sustained vibration. *On press* / *On release* = a one-shot as the trigger crosses the zone, so only the first stage of a sequence would play |
| Custom effect zone | 0–9 | 0 | *While held:* the **re-arm zone** — walls reset when the trigger returns below it; **0 = only at full release** (finger off, nothing to push against, no click). *On press / On release:* the **engage point — must be ≥ 1** |
| Custom effect A↔B toggle rate | 1–100 | 40 | **Only** for 2-state vibration actions (~2–40 Hz). Ignored for mechanical and timeline effects |
| Custom effect state count | 1–5 | — | **Auto-set** by Assign / file load; never set manually |
| Custom effect vs sliders | 3 options | Custom effect always owns | Shares the trigger with the slider stack, gated by the opposite trigger or shoulder button — see *Sharing a trigger with the sliders* below |

**Sharing a trigger with the sliders (gate hand-off)**

By default a custom effect owns its trigger outright. The **Custom effect vs
sliders** setting lets the two share instead. The gate is the physical gate
input — the **opposite trigger** pressed past that trigger's threshold, or the
**shoulder button** if its resistance mode is the shoulder-gated one:

| Setting | Gate engaged | Gate not engaged |
|---|---|---|
| Custom effect always owns (default) | custom effect | custom effect |
| Sliders while gated, custom otherwise | synthesized slider effect | custom effect |
| Custom effect while gated, sliders otherwise | custom effect | synthesized slider effect |

With R2's resistance set to *L2-gated*, the middle option gives the classic
split: hip fire plays your captured multi-stage weapon effect, and the moment L2
passes its threshold R2 switches to the synthesized resistance, kick and all. The
third option inverts it — aim down sights to get the captured effect.

Notes:
- Only one effect plays at a time; this is a **switch**, not a layer.
- The swap happens live, so changing the gate while the trigger is already held
  changes the feel under your finger.
- The slider side needs a resistance mode that is **armed in the half it
  covers** — the portal warns inline if the combination would leave one half
  silent, naming the setting to change. For *sliders while gated*, a gated resistance mode lines up exactly.
  For *custom effect while gated*, set the resistance to **always on** — the
  custom effect takes over while the gate is held, and the sliders cover the rest.
- **Force has eight levels, not a hundred.** It is a 3-bit field, so a strength
  percentage snaps to the nearest of eight steps — 10% and 21% both store level 1,
  which reads back as 14%. The builder shows the level as you type. Level 0 is the
  weakest and may not be felt at all.
- **Seeing what is on a trigger:** the same panel has *Read L2 / Read R2*, which
  decodes the effect currently stored there — each state in plain language, its raw
  bytes, and the position window it will actually be active for. Use it to check a
  captured or loaded effect, and to spot a stage that hands over before its own
  span finishes (a wall that never breaks).
- **Removing an effect:** the Build a Custom Effect panel (Triggers tab) has *Remove effect from
  R2 / L2*, which wipes that trigger's stored states, switches the custom effect
  off and returns the trigger to its sliders. Everything else on that trigger —
  including this hand-off setting — is left as you set it. Save to a slot
  afterwards to make it stick for that profile.
- Silence on either side is just that side configured off (resistance off, kick
  0, R2T off), so "captured effect while aiming, nothing otherwise" is a valid
  setup.

**Recipe: a custom effect *and* Rumble → Trigger on the same trigger**

Only one effect can occupy a trigger at a time, so a custom effect and the
rumble-driven vibration cannot both be present at once. They can **take turns**,
though, and the hand-off is what schedules it. The result is a trigger that
resists while you aim and buzzes when the shot lands:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Custom effect on L2 | your resistance, enabled |
| **Custom effect vs sliders on L2** | **Sliders while gated, custom effect otherwise** |
| L2 resistance mode | **Off** |
| L2 threshold | the R2 depth at which the swap happens |
| Rumble → Trigger mode | **Left trigger only** (or Both) |

Why it works: the trigger's order of precedence is *game effects → custom effect →
slider resistance → rumble → trigger*. Rumble sits **below** the custom effect, so
you don't gate the rumble at all — you gate the custom effect, and rumble becomes
what L2 falls back to. With the L2 resistance mode off, there is nothing in
between.

In use: hold L2 and you feel your custom resistance. Pull R2 past the L2 threshold
and L2 hands over to the rumble vibration, so the shot is felt in the hand that was
holding the aim. Release R2 and the resistance comes back, ready for the next shot.
Reverse the two triggers for the mirror-image setup.

Two things make or break the feel:

- **Keep the custom effect's strength low — around 10% (level 1/7).** A firm
  resistance makes you press hard into the trigger, and a trigger held hard against
  a stiff wall damps the vibration you are about to swap in. A light resistance is
  still clearly felt while aiming and leaves the shot its impact.
- **Set the L2 threshold just *below* the point where R2 actually fires.** The swap
  and the shot then coincide, so the resistance letting go is masked by the
  vibration arriving instead of being felt as a separate event a moment earlier.

Worth knowing: because only one effect fits, you get one tactile event when the
gate engages and another when it releases — not a click, buzz and click, since the
resistance ending and the vibration starting are the same transition. How well the
window is covered depends on how long the game's rumble lasts; a very short burst
can leave a quiet gap before you release R2.

**What works — and what doesn't — while a custom effect owns the trigger**

While the custom effect owns the trigger (always, by default — or only on one
side of the gate, if you set the hand-off above), these have **no effect** on
that trigger:

- Resistance — mode, strength, shape, start position, detent / break point, Strength B
- Push-back kick — strength, style, thump frequency
- Trigger-to-rumble (R2T)

These **still work**:

- **The game's own trigger effects** — a native game always wins; the custom effect
  yields while the game is driving that trigger.
- **The activation dead zone** — it acts on the trigger *input* the PC sees, a
  separate mechanism.
- **The other trigger** — enable is per trigger, so L2 can run the normal slider
  stack while R2 plays a captured effect.
- **Everything non-trigger** — auto-haptics, effect leak, gyro, rumble, lightbar.

The exclusivity is deliberate: the resistance/kick path engages on mode and
position even with its strength at 0, so allowing it to run alongside leaked stray
kicks (a bow snap on the next press) between custom-effect engagements.

*Tip:* to keep normal R2T/resistance in one game and captured effects in another,
put them in **separate profile slots** — the automation switches slots per game.

**Sharing effects as files**

**Save ticked to file** writes the effect as readable JSON (raw bytes, plus
durations for timeline recordings). **Load custom effect file → R2 / L2** loads one
onto a trigger and sets enable and state count automatically. The portal's *Back up all slots* JSON includes each slot's
custom-effect states as well as its settings, so a backup restores a slot
complete. (Backups taken before 1.16.0 predate this and contain settings only.)

**Building an effect by hand**

When there is nothing to capture, the **Manual effect builder** authors the same
kind of effect from scratch. Add stages one at a time and set each one up:

| Stage | What it is | Set |
|---|---|---|
| Weapon break | A wall the trigger resists, then gives way past | Start and end zone, strength |
| Bow | Rising tension that snaps back at the release point | Start and end zone, and the two force levels |
| Vibration | A buzz over a range of the pull | Zones, frequency, strength |

Stages are stacked in pull order and encoded exactly as the firmware's own
writers would emit them, so a hand-built stage is byte-identical to what the
sliders — or a game — would have sent for the same values. Built effects behave
like captured ones everywhere else: they sit in the same list, play in sequence
as you pull, save to the same JSON files, and are stored in slots the same way.
Trigger positions are expressed in the same nine zones used throughout the
trigger sections, so a wall at zones 2-3 sits where the same numbers put it in a
captured effect.

### Trigger effects — shared

Ready-to-import adaptive-trigger effects captured from real games live on the
**[Trigger effects page](https://artzox.github.io/DS5Dongle-Studio/effects.html)** — break-through walls, bows,
resistance curves and vibration you can load straight onto L2 or R2 in the portal,
then Save to a slot.

| Setting | Range | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Force Override | on/off | off | on = force R2T/AT even when a game/app is sending its own trigger effects (off = yield to the game) |

### Gyro Aiming
Maps controller motion onto the right stick — or onto a mouse — for motion aiming.

| Setting | Range | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gyro Mode | Off / L2-held / Always / Touch-enables / Ratchet | Off | When motion aiming is active (see below) |
| Sensitivity | 1–100 | 50 | Motion-to-stick gain (50 ≈ raw) |
| Vertical sensitivity | 0–100 | 0 (same as above) | Vertical gain on its own — usually lower, since a game's vertical aiming range is much smaller |
| Horizontal source | Yaw / Roll / Player space | Yaw | Yaw = turn the controller; Roll = tilt it sideways; **Player space** works out which way is down from the accelerometer and follows how you actually hold it — see below |
| Invert gyro aim | X / Y / both | off | Per-axis inversion (bit0 = X, bit1 = Y) |
| Gyro output | Right stick / Mouse / Mouse + Flick Stick | Right stick | What the motion drives — see below |
| Flick Stick — mouse counts per 360° | 500–50000 | 6500 | Calibration, Flick Stick only |

*Gyro modes:*
- **L2-held** — aim only while L2 is held (flick-stick-style precision on ADS).
- **Always** — motion aiming on at all times.
- **Touch-enables** — active only while a finger is on the touchpad.
- **Ratchet** — always on, but touching the touchpad *pauses* it so you can
  reposition (like lifting a mouse).

*Guide:* **L2-held + Yaw** is the most natural starting point for shooters — turn
the controller to fine-tune aim only when aiming down sights. Raise sensitivity if
the motion feels sluggish; use invert if the direction feels backwards.

#### Gyro as a mouse *(new in 1.24.0)*

**Gyro output** decides what the motion drives.

**Right stick** is the default and works in any game with no setup. Its ceiling is
the stick itself: an absolute input with a dead zone and a limited range, so a
fast turn pegs it and a slow one rounds away.

**Mouse** sends pointer movement instead, which is what a gyro naturally produces
— finer at low speed, and it never pegs. The catch is that many games ignore mouse
input while a gamepad is present, so this usually needs the pad hidden from that
game (HidHide). Selecting it adds a HID interface, so the controller re-enumerates
once.

Mouse sensitivity uses the same **Sensitivity** slider, but expect to run much
higher numbers than on the stick — roughly 25–75 is the usable band. The feel is
matched across polling rates, so switching between 250 Hz and real-time does not
change how far a given movement turns you.

#### Flick Stick *(new in 1.24.0)*

**Mouse + Flick Stick** adds [Flick Stick](http://gyrowiki.jibbsmart.com/blog:good-gyro-controls-part-2:the-flick-stick)
to the right stick, implemented to Jibb Smart's specification. He invented it, and
it is designed to pair with gyro aim rather than replace it:

- **Flick** — push the stick in a direction and the view snaps to face that way.
  Straight back is a 180.
- **Turn** — keep the stick held and rotate it, and the view follows.
- **Fine aim is the gyro's job.** The stick stops being an aiming device at all.

The stick's own output is removed from the report while this is on, so the game
does not also turn from it. Below 90% deflection nothing happens: the dead zone is
deliberately huge because a flick must be intentional.

Flick Stick works even with **Gyro Mode** off — it is a stick feature — but you
almost certainly want the gyro on as well, since that is what handles precision.
**Always** is the simplest choice while you calibrate.

**Calibration is required**, and it is per game. The dongle converts a stick angle
into a number of mouse counts, so it needs to know how far a full turn is in that
game:

```
mouse counts per 360° = (cm per 360°) × (DPI ÷ 2.54)
```

If you know your cm/360 and DPI, that *is* the number. Otherwise leave the 6500
default and correct once: flick straight back, see how far you actually turned,
then multiply by `180 ÷ (degrees you got)`. Two tries is usually enough. Flicking
back twice is easier to judge than once — you should land exactly where you began.

> Turn **mouse acceleration off and raw input on** in the game. Flick Stick
> converts an angle into a fixed number of counts and assumes the game turns a
> fixed amount per count; with acceleration, no single calibration value can be
> correct. Changing the game's own sensitivity also means recalibrating.

#### Player space *(new in 1.38.2)*

Yaw and Roll each assume a particular grip. Turning the controller drives the aim
only while the pad is roughly flat; tilting it sideways only while it is roughly
upright. Hold it any other way and part of the movement lands on the wrong axis —
a level left-right sweep starts dragging the cursor diagonally, and with the pad
on its edge it barely turns the view at all. That is why picking an axis also
means committing to a grip.

**Player space** reads gravity from the accelerometer to work out which way is
down, then measures how much your movement turned you about the world's vertical
axis. Flat, tilted up, rolled onto its edge — the aim behaves the same. Vertical
aim is corrected the same way, so it stays vertical instead of picking up part of
a horizontal turn.

Gravity is low-passed, so a knock does not throw the aim, and it falls back to
plain yaw if the reading is not sane gravity (a hard shake, or free fall).

To see the difference: aim with the pad flat, then roll it 45° sideways and make
the same movement. On Yaw the cursor goes diagonal; on Player space it does not
change. Roll it a full 90° and Yaw stops turning the view horizontally almost
entirely, while Player space is unaffected.

Yaw and Roll are unchanged and Yaw remains the default.

### Right Stick Inversion
Inverts the physical right stick in the input report the PC sees — independent of
gyro aiming, and active in any game with no PC-side software.

| Setting | Range | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Invert Right Stick | X / Y / both | off | Per-axis inversion of the physical stick (bit0 = X, bit1 = Y). Applies whether or not gyro is on. |

Useful for inverted-look setups, or games that only offer inversion on one axis.
Because it rewrites the stick values in the report itself it works everywhere, and
it composes with gyro aiming — the stick is inverted first, then the gyro delta is
added on top with its own invert. *(New in 1.18.21.)*

### Gyro sensitivity: Natural or Manual *(new in 1.32.0)*

Two ways to set gyro aiming. **Natural** (the default on a fresh install)
expresses it as a real-world ratio: at 1.0x, rotating the controller 10 degrees
turns the view 10 degrees, and the same setting is correct in every game that
shares the same mouse counts per 360. **Manual** is the original slider — a
number with no real-world meaning that you tune by feel, per game.

Natural applies to gyro-to-**mouse** only. Gyro-to-stick tells the game how fast
to turn rather than how far, so a rotation ratio has nothing to attach to there,
and the setting is ignored.

#### Setting up Natural — step by step

1. **Set gyro output to Mouse** in the Gyro tab.
2. **Calibrate the sensor once.** Gyro tab → *Gyro calibration* → *Gyro angle check* → **Measure**,
   then make one full 360-degree turn during the countdown, ending exactly where
   you started. Line the controller up with a desk edge or door frame so you can
   return to it precisely. Repeat two or three times.
   - Reads within 5% of 360? Leave **Gyro scale trim** at 100.
   - Reads high or low? The panel gives you the trim value to enter — set it,
     then measure again to confirm it now reads ~360.
3. **Measure the game's mouse counts per 360.** This belongs to the *game*, not
   the controller — it is the same number Flick Stick needs. Gyro tab →
   *Gyro calibration* → *Counts per 360* → press **Send 6500 counts** (you get a few seconds to
   switch to the game), read how far the view turned, type that in and press
   **Work it out**. Sight a landmark before sending and judge against it. Turn
   off in-game mouse acceleration and smoothing first, or no single value can
   be correct. You can also calculate it as `(cm per 360) x (DPI / 2.54)` if
   you know your mouse settings.
4. **Pick a multiplier.** 10 (=1.0x) is literal 1:1 — the camera tracks your
   hands exactly, which is precise but only turns as far as your wrists do. Most
   people run 25-120 (2.5x-12x): lower if the stick does the big turns and the
   gyro only fine-aims, higher for gyro-led play.
5. **Set a vertical multiplier** if wanted. A game's vertical aiming range is
   much smaller than its horizontal one, so a lower value than the horizontal is
   common; 0 follows the horizontal one.

Change games and only step 3 changes. Steps 2 and 4 stay.

#### Setting up Manual

Set the scale to Manual and adjust **Gyro Sensitivity** until it feels right.
Nothing to calibrate, nothing to look up — but the number means nothing outside
that game, so expect to redo it for the next one. Manual is also the right
choice when a game's mouse handling makes counts-per-360 meaningless (forced
acceleration or smoothing that cannot be disabled).

| Setting | Range | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gyro sensitivity scale | Manual / Natural | Natural | Natural needs counts per 360; Manual is the original slider |
| Natural multiplier x10 | 5-200 | 10 (= 1.0x) | 10 is true 1:1; most play at 25-120 |
| Natural vertical x10 | 0-200 | 0 (= same) | Separate vertical ratio |
| Gyro scale trim | 50-1000 | 100 | Corrects the sensor's scale; set from the angle check |
| Mouse counts per 360 | 500-50000 | 6500 | Shared with Flick Stick — calibrate once, both use it |

### Stick to Mouse *(new in 1.30.0)*
Drives the mouse from a stick, for games that aim better with a mouse than with a
stick — or alongside gyro aiming, with the stick doing the large turns and the
gyro the fine aim. Both paths feed the same mouse, so they add rather than fight.

| Setting | Range | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Drive the mouse from a stick | Off / Right / Left | Off | The chosen stick is centred in what the game receives, so the game does not also turn from it |
| Speed | 0–20000 | 0 (= 600/s) | Mouse counts per second at full tilt. Raise until a full push turns as fast as you want |
| Vertical speed | 0–20000 | 0 (= same as Speed) | Separate vertical rate. Games use a much smaller vertical aiming range, so the gain that feels right for turning is usually too fast for looking up and down — try half of Speed |
| Deadzone | 0–50 % | 8 | Sticks rest slightly off centre and a mouse never stops, so without a deadzone the view creeps. Applied radially, so diagonals behave |
| Response curve | 10–40 | 18 | Exponent ×10. 10 is linear — twitchy at the centre, slow at the edge. 18 gives fine control near centre and full speed at the edge |
| Invert stick-to-mouse | X / Y / both | off | Per axis, independent of the physical stick inversion above |

Sub-count movement is carried between ticks, so slow stick pressure still moves
the pointer instead of being truncated away.

Three things worth knowing. It needs the mouse HID interface, so switching it on
or off **re-enumerates the device**, exactly like setting gyro output to Mouse.
It is **mutually exclusive with Flick Stick**, which also claims the right stick
— choosing one clears the other rather than leaving both writing the same
report. And as with gyro-to-mouse, a game that reads the pad *and* the mouse may
need the controller hidden with HidHide, or it receives the movement twice.

### Touchpad as Mouse *(new in 1.37.0)*

Uses the touchpad as a trackpad. It is **relative**: the pointer follows how far
your finger *moves*, so you can lift and reposition exactly as you would on a
laptop. Useful from the sofa, where reaching for a mouse is the whole problem.

Settings are on the **Device** tab, in their own *Touchpad as Mouse* section.

| Setting | Range | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Touchpad as Mouse | on/off | off | Adds the mouse HID interface, so the device re-enumerates once when you turn it on or off |
| Touchpad Speed | 1–250 | 100 | Pointer speed. 100 crosses most of a screen in one swipe |
| Touchpad Jitter Filter | 0–20 | 1 | Ignores finger movement smaller than this many pad counts, so a resting finger does not make the pointer drift |
| Touchpad Invert | None / X / Y / Both | None | Flips the pointer direction per axis |
| Touchpad Trackball | on/off | off | Keeps the pointer gliding after you lift off, so one flick can cross a large screen |
| Trackball Friction | 1–100 | 10 | Fraction of speed shed every 100 ms. Higher stops sooner; 10 glides for roughly two seconds |

**Clicks are not part of this setting, on purpose.** The touchpad-click halves
are already macro triggers and can output mouse buttons, so left and right click
are one macro row each — and you choose which half is which, rather than being
given a fixed corner. See the Macros section.

It shares the pointer accumulator with gyro aiming and Stick to Mouse, so the
three **add** rather than fight, and sub-count movement is carried between ticks
so slow drags still register.

> Two gyro activation schemes use the touchpad themselves and do not combine
> well with this: *only while the touchpad is touched* runs the gyro during
> exactly the drag that is moving the pointer, so both add together and the
> pointer overshoots, and *ratchet* pauses the gyro whenever you touch the pad,
> so you get pointer or gyro but never both. The portal warns when either is
> selected. Gate the gyro on a trigger or a shoulder instead.

There is no on/off chord. Enablement is per profile and profiles load per game,
so a desktop profile can have it on while every game profile leaves it off.

### Tilt steering *(new in 1.39.4)*

Roll the controller like a small steering wheel and it **adds** to the left
stick. It does not replace it: coarse steering stays on the stick, where it is
precise, and tilt supplies the fine control on top. The angle comes from gravity,
so it never drifts and always returns to centre when you level the pad.

Settings are on the **Device** tab, in the *Tilt Steering* section.

| Setting | Range | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tilt Steering | on/off | off | Roll left and right adds to the left stick's X |
| Tilt range | 1–90° | 45 | How far you roll the pad for the full effect |
| Maximum stick added | 0–100% | 70 | Racing games apply their own steering dead zone, so below about 60 nothing happens you can feel. 70 is usable trim; 100 lets tilt steer on its own |
| Tilt dead zone | 0–30° | 3 | Degrees around level that do nothing, so your natural grip does not steer for you |
| Invert tilt direction | on/off | off | Flip which way a roll steers |
| Also tilt forward/back | on/off | off | Leaning adds to the left stick's Y — for bikes and weight shift, not cars |
| Maximum stick added, lean | 0–100% | 70 | Separate from steering: how much lean a game wants is not how much steering it wants |
| Invert lean direction | on/off | off | Flip which way a lean pushes |

**Calibrate with the live test** on the Macros tab. Roll the pad and watch the
**L stick** figure — that is the value the game receives, so you can size the
offset against the game's own dead zone. A setting that looks active in the
portal can still be swallowed before it reaches the car.

The **Device tab diagnostics** show the angles and the offsets being applied,
which distinguishes "not running" from "running but too small to matter".

> Tilt-only steering was tried across the SIXAXIS era and consistently judged too
> imprecise to replace a stick, because the entire steering range lived in a wrist
> angle you cannot hold steady while being thrown around a track. Adding to the
> stick avoids that: the stick keeps the coarse work, and tilt only has to supply
> the last few percent.

### Macros (new in 1.19.0)

Bind a controller button press or a touchpad swipe to a keyboard combo. For example you can press
**R3 + D-pad Up** and map to **Ctrl+J**, if you use the RivaTuner OSD; swipe left across the touchpad
and it receives whatever you assigned. No PC-side software is involved — the
dongle sends the keystrokes itself over the same HID keyboard interface the wake
feature uses.

Everything is edited on the **Macros** tab.

| Column | What it does |
|---|---|
| Checkbox | Enables this macro **for the current profile**. Per-slot — see below. |
| Name | Up to 15 characters, stored on the dongle so your names survive a different PC or a cleared browser. |
| Record input | Press it, then hold the buttons you want or swipe the touchpad, then press **Stop**. |
| Pick (input) | Tick the trigger buttons by hand instead of holding them. Same result as recording — useful for anything the controller consumes before it transmits, such as an assigned Edge paddle. |
| Record output | Press it, then type the key combo on your real keyboard, then press **Stop**. |
| **+** / **−** | Adds or removes a macro row. (The checkbox enables; the minus deletes.) |

Up to **32 macros**.

#### Tap or hold — the recording decides

While recording the input, the duration you hold the controller button(s) sets its mode:

- **Tap** the controller button → the macro fires on press.
- **Hold** it for roughly half a second or more → it becomes a long-press macro,
  and the duration you actually held is stored as the threshold. The row then
  reads e.g. `R3 + D-pad Up (hold 0.75s)`.

You can bind the same controller button twice, once short and once long, exactly the way the
PS button gives you one action on a tap and another on a hold.

One consequence worth knowing: if a button press is bound to **both** a short and a long macro,
the short one can only fire when you *release*, because until then there is no way
to tell a short press from the start of a long one. A button press with only a short-time
macro fires immediately on press.

#### Release order is captured

Recording **Alt+Tab** stores that you released Tab before Alt, and playback
reproduces that order. This matters for combos where the modifier must outlive the
key.

Some combos cannot be captured in a browser, because Windows or the browser takes
them first — anything with the **Win** key, **Alt+Tab** itself, and
**Ctrl+W / Ctrl+T / F11**. The recorder tells you when it saw something it could
not read; use the **Pick** button on that row to set the combo by hand — modifier tick-boxes plus a key list, writing exactly what a recording would.

#### Touchpad swipes

Four directions, distinguished by which half of the pad the swipe **starts** on
and whether you use one or two fingers. A swipe has no release, so it always fires
a single pulse — tap-versus-hold does not apply.

Matching is exact: a macro recorded as *swipe right, left half* only fires on a
swipe that starts on the left half.

The touchpad **click** is a separate thing: it is an ordinary button, so it can be
recorded on its own or as part of a chord, and it can hold. A swipe is only stored
as a swipe when nothing was held during it — press the pad while swiping and you
get the chord, not the gesture.

**Left and right clicks are distinguishable.** The pad has one physical switch, so
the click itself cannot tell you where you pressed — but the finger position is in
the same report, so a click is recorded as *Touchpad click (left)* or *(right)*
depending on which half your finger was on. Three ways to use that:

| Recorded as | Fires on |
|---|---|
| Touchpad click (left) | left half only |
| Touchpad click (right) | right half only |
| Touchpad click | either half — the generic click |

The half is decided when the press starts and held until release, so a finger
that moves during the click cannot switch it, and a band of about 8% either side
of the centre line is treated as neither half — a click there fires only a
generic touchpad-click binding, rather than guessing. Aim for the outer thirds
of the pad and the halves are unambiguous.

Clicking a half records as that half alone, so the row reads *Touchpad click
(left)* rather than naming two buttons for one press. The generic binding is still
available from **Pick** when you want either half to fire the same macro, and the
three are mutually exclusive there — one press cannot be both "either half" and
"this half".

Macros recorded before this existed are generic clicks and keep firing on both
halves. Bind both a generic and a half-specific macro and the specific one wins,
the same way a longer chord beats a shorter one. If the switch fires with no
finger reported — a knuckle, or the very edge of the pad — the click stays
unqualified, so only a generic binding catches it.

#### The two halves are stored differently, and this is the useful part

| | Where it lives | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| The macro definitions | Their own area of the dongle's flash | **Shared by every profile** |
| Which macros are enabled | The profile itself | **Per-slot** |

So you define a macro once and then choose, per game, whether it is live. Save a
slot and it captures the current set of ticked boxes; the Playnite automation then
switches macro sets per game with no extra setup.

Press **Save macros to device** to store both the definitions and the enable state.
The panel warns you when the enable state has changed but not yet been saved.

> **Enabling the first macro re-enumerates the controller.** Macros share the
> keyboard interface with the wake feature, so switching from "no macros" to "at
> least one" changes the USB descriptor and the device briefly disconnects and
> reappears. Switching *which* macros are on costs nothing, and if **Enable Wake**
> is already on the interface is present anyway, so there is no reconnect at all.
> This is the same constraint as wake: a game with native DualSense support may
> stop recognising the controller while the keyboard interface is present.

#### DualSense Edge buttons *(new in 1.29.0)*

The Edge's two **Fn** buttons and two **paddles** are available as macro inputs.
They were always in the controller's report and simply never read.

> **Read this first: a paddle only reaches the dongle if it is UNASSIGNED.**
> The Edge maps paddles *inside the controller*, before anything is transmitted.
> A paddle assigned in Sony's app — or in the on-board profile you are currently
> using — is sent as **whatever it was mapped to**: assign it to Cross and the
> report says Cross, with the paddle bit never set. It does not arrive as "a
> paddle" and then also as Cross, so there is nothing here that can intercept or
> override it. To use a paddle as a macro input, clear its assignment in the
> Sony app (or select an on-board profile that leaves it empty) — then the
> paddle bit is set and the dongle can see it. This is also why a paddle can
> appear to work in one on-board profile and be invisible in another.

**Fn + D-pad is the combination to build on.** Sony's own app uses **Fn + a face
button** to switch the controller's on-board profiles, so chords there fight it —
but nothing claims Fn + a D-pad direction, so those cannot collide with normal
play or with the app.

**The Fn buttons themselves are only partly yours.** Fn is reported to the dongle
like any other button, but the controller keeps acting on its own combinations at
the same time — pressing Fn with a face button still switches on-board profiles
whatever you bind here. Build on Fn + D-pad and that does not arise; build on
Fn + face and you get your macro *and* a profile switch.

They behave like any other button otherwise: chords, hold, replace, keyboard,
controller and mouse outputs all work, and a standard DualSense simply never sets
them.

Macro outputs cover the face buttons, L1/R1, L3/R3, L2/R2, **Create, Options,
Touchpad click and the four D-pad directions**, plus keyboard keys and mouse
actions. A D-pad output merges with whatever the player is holding: the injected
direction wins on its own axis and the other axis is left alone, so "press Up"
presses Up even mid-lean. PS and Mute are not offered — PS collides with the
PS-shortcut feature, and Mute toggles a state rather than acting as a button.

*Hide input from game* works on these too, so an Fn button or paddle bound to a
macro can be kept from reaching the game like any other button.

**If recording will not capture one**, use **Pick** next to *Record input* and
tick the buttons by hand — it writes exactly the same chord. That is the reliable
route for a paddle you have not cleared yet, or for any combination the
controller consumes before it is transmitted.

#### Motion gestures *(new in 1.20.0)*

A third way to trigger a macro: hold a button and flick your wrists with the
controller. Hold **L2**, flick **down then up**, release — and the macro fires.

The held button is a **gate**, not a modifier. It marks when you are "drawing", so
the dongle is not watching your wrist the whole time you play. Recording starts
when the gate goes down (button is pressed) and the gesture is matched when you let go.

| | |
|---|---|
| Strokes per gesture | 1–4 (up to 8 are stored) |
| Directions | up, down, left, right |
| Gate | any button or combination, held while you flick |
| Fires | on release of the gate |

While a gate is held, **gyro aiming is suspended** — the same wrist movement that
makes the gesture would otherwise swing your aim. It resumes the moment you let
go.

**Recording calibrates to you.** Press **Record motion**, hold the gate, flick the controller, release. 
The portal measures how far you actually moved and stores a step
size with that macro, so a small flick and a broad sweep are both recognised as
what you performed. A fixed threshold chosen without your hardware in front of it
does not survive contact with a real wrist.

Two behaviours worth knowing, both learned the hard way:

- **Only the start of the window has to match.** Holding the gate a beat longer
  after finishing adds strokes — a clean *down-up* becomes *down up down up right
  down*. Trailing movement is treated as settling and ignored.
- **A single-stroke gesture is matched strictly.** Longer gestures tolerate one
  stray stroke inside the match, because a reversal often drifts. Allowing that
  on a one-stroke gesture would make a leftward flick that sagged match both
  *left* and *down*.

Gestures are macros like any other, so they carry names, live in the same 32
rows, and are enabled per profile.

#### Remapping: hold, replace and other outputs *(new in 1.26.0)*

A macro row does not have to send a keystroke. Two settings turn it into a remap:

| Setting | What it does |
|---|---|
| **hold while held** | The output is asserted while the input is held, instead of firing once. A remap needs this — without it `X → Circle` taps Circle when you *release* X. |
| **hide input from game** | The original input is removed from the report, so the game sees only the replacement. Only available alongside **hold while held**, and it hides the trigger for *every* row bound to it, not just its own. |
| **double tap** *(new in 1.34.0)* | The row fires on two presses of its trigger within 250 ms. Not available on a hold row or a long press. A controller or mouse output is pressed briefly and released, since a one-shot has to hold the button down long enough for the game to sample it. |

**Output** chooses where it goes:

- **Keyboard** — a key combination, as before.
- **Controller button** — any face, shoulder, stick or trigger button. More reliable in-game than a keystroke: a game that sees a DualSense is in controller mode, and many ignore the keyboard entirely or flip every on-screen prompt when one arrives.
- **Mouse** — left, right or middle click, or scroll up/down. Clicks hold while the input is held, so click-and-drag works; scroll sends one tick per press.

**Record** and **Pick** work the same way for all three. Record captures what you
actually do — press the controller button, or click the mouse — and Pick lets you
choose by hand. Selecting a controller or mouse output turns **hold while held**
on for you, since that is what a remap almost always means.

A **double tap** costs nothing unless you use it. A single tap can only be
resolved late if a double-tap row exists on the *same* trigger — until the window
closes there is no way to know which was meant — so only that trigger waits.
Every other row still fires the instant the button goes down, and a table with no
double-tap rows behaves exactly as it did before.

**Remapping one trigger onto the other stays analog.** `L2 → R2` carries the
travel across, so a variable throttle stays variable rather than collapsing into
an on/off switch. Any other input driving a trigger is a full press, since there
is no travel to copy.

> Choosing a **mouse** output makes the dongle present a mouse to the PC, so the
> controller re-enumerates once — but only when you **save**, never while you are
> editing.

#### One button, a single tap and a double tap, with the button hidden

**hide input from game** is only offered on a row with **hold while held**,
because suppression is a property of a held row. **double tap** is the opposite:
it cannot be a hold row, since a held key has to go down the moment the button
does and cannot wait to see whether a second press arrives. So the two settings
are never available on the same row, and it looks as though a double tap cannot
hide its trigger.

It can — the hiding just does not have to come from the same row. Suppression
applies to the **trigger**, not to one row, so any held row that names it hides
it for every row bound to it. Give the job to a row of its own:

| Row | Input | Output | hold while held | hide input from game | double tap |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | X | *(leave empty)* | ✔ | ✔ | — |
| 2 | X | your single-tap output | — | — | — |
| 3 | X | your double-tap output | — | — | ✔ |

Row 1 has no output at all. Its only purpose is to remove X from the report
while it is held, which covers both of the other rows. Rows 2 and 3 are one-shots,
so the single tap is held back for the double-tap window and fires only if no
second press arrives.

Keeping rows 2 and 3 the same *kind* matters. A one-shot writes the whole
keyboard report while it plays, so any key another row is holding is released
for the moment it takes — a held key would blink each time the double tap fires.
With both as one-shots there is nothing being held to interrupt.

#### Sticks as an input *(new in 1.26.0)*

A whole stick can drive four outputs, one per direction — `W A S D` being the
obvious use. Diagonals press both, and each axis has its own threshold with
hysteresis so a stick resting on the edge does not chatter.

#### Backing up and sharing macros *(new in 1.19.1)*

Definitions and enablement travel separately, because they are stored separately.

| Action | Carries | Asks |
|---|---|---|
| **Export macros** / **Import macros** (Macros tab) | the definitions | import confirms — it replaces all of them |
| **Export Profile** / **Import Profile** | which macros are enabled | import confirms, and names what would fire |
| **Export HTML** and the Playnite auto-apply page | **nothing about macros** | n/a |
| **Back up all slots** / **Restore** | both | asks about definitions, both ways |

**Import macros** replaces every macro on the dongle, for all profiles. It loads
into the editor rather than writing straight to the device, so nothing is
committed until you press **Save macros to device**.

**Importing a profile asks before changing your macro selection**, and lists what
that selection would switch on. It has to: a profile carries only the enable mask,
so it turns on *your* macros in those rows — which may be nothing like what the
profile's author had there. Decline and your current selection is left alone while
every other setting still imports.

**The auto-apply page carries no macro information at all.** Two reasons, either
sufficient. It runs unattended on every game launch, so there is nobody to answer
that question — and enabling the first macro re-enumerates the controller, which
is the same mid-apply interruption hazard that makes wake unsuitable for a
field-by-field `.html` profile. Per-game macro sets belong on the slot path, where
the whole configuration is applied in one command.

#### Two limits to be aware of

- **Keyboard keys only.** Media and volume keys need a different USB descriptor
  and are not supported.
- **Don't bind a controller button press that contains another bound press.** With both `R3` and
  `R3 + D-pad Up` enabled, pressing R3 first fires the R3 macro and the longer
  combo never fires — at the moment R3 goes down the firmware cannot know whether
  a second button is coming. The portal warns you when it spots this.

### Device & Connection

| Setting | Range | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Controller Type | DualSense (DS5) / DualSense Edge (DSE) / Auto-detect | Auto-detect | Which pad identity the dongle presents to the PC. Auto-detect follows the controller actually paired; force one if a game only recognises a specific model. Changing this re-enumerates the device. |
| Polling Rate | 250 / 500 / Real-time | Real-time | USB report rate |
| Audio Buffer Length | 16–128 | 64 | Lower = snappier haptics/lower latency; higher = more audio stability |
| Inactive Time (min) | 5–60 | 30 | Idle timeout before disconnect |
| Disable Inactive Disconnect | on/off | off | Never auto-disconnect when idle |
| Lightbar Off | on/off | off | Keeps the controller's lightbar dark in every haptics mode. Since the haptics mode is per profile, "dark in this game, lit in that one" is a matter of using two profiles. A battery notification still overrides this for the seconds it runs. |
| Player LEDs | Passthrough / Off / Battery gauge | Passthrough | The five white LEDs under the touchpad. See *Player LEDs* below |
| Player LED brightness | Bright / Mid / Dim | Bright | Independent of the lightbar. Kept in every mode, including Passthrough, where the game still chooses which LEDs are lit. Bright leaves brightness to the game |
| Disable Pico LED | on/off | off | Turn off the Pico's onboard LED |
| Wake PC on PS Button | on/off | off | Assert USB remote wakeup on PS press to wake the host |

### Battery notification *(new in 1.35.0)*

Pulses the **controller's lightbar** when the battery drops, as a prompt to go
and charge — and again whenever you switch the controller on, so you always know
what you are starting with. Three independent stages, each with its own level,
colour and number of pulses — 3 amber at 50% and 10 red at 10%, say. A stage fires **once** and
then stops. Nothing keeps flashing until you plug in.

Each stage is a line on the **Device** tab: a tick to enable it, the level, the
number of pulses, a colour picker, and a **Test** button that runs that stage
straight away so a colour can be judged without draining a controller.

> **Test uses the settings already saved to the dongle.** Save before testing,
> or you will be looking at the previous colour and count.

> To see the real thing rather than the Test button, set a stage to **100%** and
> reconnect the controller. Any charge below that qualifies, so it fires through
> the genuine path — the battery reading, the discharging check and the level
> comparison — instead of the shortcut Test takes.

| Setting | Range | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Battery notification on the controller lightbar | on/off | off | Master switch for all three stages |
| Stage enabled | on/off | off | Kept separate from the level, so turning a stage off does not lose the level and colour set for it |
| Notify at battery level | 10%–100% | — | **10% steps only.** That is the resolution the DualSense reports its own charge at; a value in between is not something the controller can tell us |
| Number of pulses | 1–20 | 5 | One pulse fades up and back down over about 1.6 s, so 10 pulses runs for roughly 16 s |
| Colour | any | — | Chosen with a colour picker |

**How it behaves**

- Only while **discharging**. Charging or complete says you are already doing the
  thing the notification would ask for.
- A stage cannot re-announce itself while the charge sits on a boundary: it
  stays fired until the level genuinely rises again.
- **It reports on connect.** Switch a controller on and any stage its charge is
  already at or below fires straight away, so you know where you stand before
  you start playing rather than finding out when it dies mid-session. This is
  deliberate, and it is the most useful thing the feature does: the alternative
  is silence until the battery happens to cross a line while you are holding it.
- When more than one stage qualifies — on connect, or if the charge drops past
  two at once — **each one pulses in turn**, so a controller connected at 20%
  with stages at 100%, 50% and 30% plays all three. Set fewer stages, or set
  them closer to the levels you actually care about, if that is more than you
  want to watch.
- Each stage fires **once**. It re-arms only when the charge climbs back above
  it or the controller goes on charge, so nothing repeats while you keep
  playing.
- It **overrides everything else on the lightbar** for the few seconds it runs,
  including *Lightbar Off in Replace Mode* and whatever a game is driving in
  native mode. Being seen is the entire point. The lightbar is written back
  afterwards.

**This is separate from the Pico LED**, which is unchanged and blinks
continuously below 10%. The two suit different distances — the Pico LED when the
dongle is on the desk in front of you, the lightbar from across the room — and
most people will want one or the other rather than both.


### Player LEDs *(new in 1.41.6)*

The five white LEDs under the touchpad normally show a player number, which on a
single-player PC tells you nothing. **Player LEDs** on the Device tab takes them
over:

| Mode | What the LEDs show |
|---|---|
| Passthrough | Whatever the game and controller set — the original behaviour |
| Off | Nothing |
| Battery gauge | A bar filled from the left, one LED per 20% |

**Reading the battery gauge**

The controller reports its charge in 10% steps, so these are the readings that
produce each pattern:

| Reported charge | LEDs |
|---|---|
| 90–100% | ■■■■■ |
| 70–80% | ■■■■□ |
| 50–60% | ■■■□□ |
| 30–40% | ■■□□□ |
| 20% and below | ■□□□□, blinking |

A change only shows once the new reading has held for five seconds, so a charge
that hovers on a boundary does not make an LED flicker. Charge moves by minutes
per step, so the delay is not noticeable.

- **Charging** — the filled LEDs stay solid and the next one up pulses slowly,
  locking solid as each 20% step is reached. Full is all five, steady.
- **Low** — below 20% the first LED blinks on its own, faster than the charging
  pulse, so the two cannot be confused.

**Player LED brightness** (Bright / Mid / Dim) is kept in every mode,
independently of the lightbar. In **Passthrough** the game still decides which
LEDs are lit, but a Mid or Dim setting survives a game setting its own
brightness. **Bright** leaves brightness entirely to the game.

This complements the battery notification rather than replacing it: the gauge is
something you glance at to see how much is left; the lightbar pulse is a prompt
that finds you when it is time to act.

> Taking over the LEDs means the game can no longer show a player number. On a
> DualSense Edge the gauge works alongside the controller's own on-board profile
> display. Later standard DualSense hardware revisions are documented as
> supporting only *mirrored* patterns, so a left-to-right bar may render
> symmetrically on those.

The Device tab diagnostics show the whole chain on one line — the mode as the
firmware sees it, whether it is running, the battery byte it is reading, and the
pattern being sent — so a gauge that looks wrong can be traced to the link that
is actually at fault.

### Advanced — BT Latency (experimental)

| Setting | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| BT Flush Timeout | Off | Drop stale packets instead of retransmitting. No clear benefit on a strong link; left in for tinkering. |
| BT QoS Latency | Off | Request a tighter poll interval. Inconclusive in testing; left in for tinkering. |

---

## Modes explained

- **Off** — The controller behaves as the base firmware: native DualSense haptics
  pass through unfiltered, and (with DS4Windows + a single isolated controller)
  Xbox360/DS4 rumble is converted to DualSense rumble. **Use this for games that
  already have good native DualSense haptics** — it gives full fidelity.
- **Mix** — Native haptic channels (low-passed) + audio-derived haptics +
  optional converted DS4Windows rumble. For games without native haptics where you
  also want emulated-controller rumble.
- **Replace** — Audio-derived haptics only. Cleanest option for non-native games.

---

## Notes & known behavior

- **Saving / PlayStation app:** Settings are written to flash and applied
  immediately. Most settings apply live with no reconnect; only a few that require
  USB re-enumeration (polling rate, audio buffer, mic/speaker enable, wake) trigger
  a brief reconnect on save. If you have the PlayStation accessory app open, after
  saving you may need to **wait 2–3 seconds** before reopening the setting to see
  the updated value, or simply **open it a second time** — the display lags
  slightly, but the settings are saved correctly.
- **Effect leak latency.** The effect leak goes through the controller's speaker
  audio pipeline (Opus codec over Bluetooth), which has inherent latency. Transient
  effects expose this more than continuous audio would. It is reduced as much as
  the codec allows but is not zero.
- **Speaker crackle / pops — set the host audio device to 48 kHz.** The firmware's
  speaker audio pipeline (USB audio in, Opus over Bluetooth) runs at **48 kHz**. If
  the dongle's audio output device in **Windows Sound settings → device →
  Properties → Advanced → Default Format** is set to any other rate (44.1 kHz, 96
  kHz, etc.), Windows resamples to feed the 48 kHz endpoint and the rate mismatch
  causes continuous crackle at every frequency — regardless of volume, Bluetooth
  signal, or audio buffer length. Set the format to **16-bit or 24-bit, 48000 Hz**
  and the crackle clears. This is the fix for nearly all speaker-crackle reports.
  (Speaker audio over Bluetooth is inherently marginal — Sony disables it entirely
  on a stock DualSense over BT — so a trace of imperfection can remain even at
  48 kHz; muting the speaker in Mix mode and using haptics only avoids the pipeline
  altogether.)
- **Game crashes at launch when the automation runs (or when any window appears)
  — switch the game to Borderless.** Some games — especially older engines and
  remasters (e.g. Nightdive's KEX titles) — run in EXCLUSIVE fullscreen and
  mishandle the device-lost event that any focus loss triggers, crashing with a
  D3D "invalid call" / render-target error. The automation's profile window (or a
  console window from running `python ds5audio.py` manually — use `pythonw` to
  avoid one) is enough to trip it, which makes the crash look automation-related
  when the real fragility is the display mode. Diagnostic: launch the game bare
  and alt-tab — if it crashes the same way, it's the game. Fix: set the game to
  **Borderless/Windowed** — no exclusive mode switches, focus changes become
  harmless, and the automation works unmodified (borderless has effectively no
  performance cost on modern Windows).
- **Bluetooth vs USB latency.** Native haptics over Bluetooth are slightly less
  tight than over USB — this is inherent to the BT transport (slot scheduling vs
  USB's fixed microframes) and is not tunable away in firmware. A strong link
  (check the RSSI display) keeps it as good as it gets.
- **WebHID requires Chrome/Edge** and a secure context (download the portal file or
  serve from localhost). Firefox and Safari do not support WebHID.
- **Firmware upgrades preserve your settings and slots.** Config and profile
  slots carry across a normal reflash, and settings from older layouts are
  migrated automatically on first boot (fields that didn't exist yet take safe
  defaults). You only need `flash_nuke.uf2` if the config appears corrupted or a
  release explicitly calls for it. After a layout change it's still worth opening
  the portal to check any new settings and re-saving slots that use them.
- **Wake from sleep** depends on the host's sleep state. USB device remote-wakeup
  works from traditional S3 sleep; behavior under Modern Standby (S0 Low Power Idle)
  varies by system, and the device's "Allow this device to wake the computer"
  setting must be enabled in Windows Device Manager. Connecting from sleep can take
  a few extra seconds (the controller's Bluetooth is powered off during sleep and
  must re-establish on wake); some variability here is inherent to the Bluetooth
  reconnect path.
- **Wake and DS4Windows.** With wake enabled the bridge stays on the USB bus while
  the controller is switched off, whether or not the PC is asleep — that presence is
  exactly what makes waking possible, including the normal case where you switch the
  controller off before putting the PC to sleep. It does not leave a phantom
  controller behind: while the controller is off it presents a separate USB identity
  (*DS5Dongle (controller off)*, its own vendor and product IDs), which DS4Windows
  does not match and therefore ignores, leaving it free to auto-load profiles for
  other controllers. The DualSense identity returns when the controller reconnects.
  The idle identity is visible in `joy.cpl` and under Settings → Bluetooth & devices
  → Devices, has its own *Allow this device to wake the computer* setting, and can be
  hidden with HidHide without affecting waking. With wake **off**, the bridge leaves
  the bus entirely when the controller disconnects, as before.
- **Wake and native haptics (Steam Input).** Enabling wake alters the USB descriptor
  (USB 2.1 + BOS descriptor + an added keyboard interface — all required by remote
  wakeup). Because the device then no longer matches a plain DualSense fingerprint,
  Steam Input may treat it as a generic/XInput pad: games like *Ratchet & Clank* can
  revert to Xbox-style rumble instead of native DualSense haptics, and speaker audio
  may stop. There is no way to keep wake's descriptor changes *and* the exact
  DualSense fingerprint Steam Input wants — they conflict by design. Additionally,
  toggling wake forces a USB re-enumeration that disrupts the portal connection, so
  applying a wake change through an auto-apply profile is unreliable. **Recommended:
  choose wake on or off once and leave it — don't switch it per-game.** If you rely
  on native haptics or the auto-apply profiles, keep wake **off**.
- **Upgrading to 1.14.0 (custom effects).** The on-device configuration layout
  changed in this release. Existing settings migrate, but any custom captured
  effect assigned under a pre-1.14.0 test build must be **re-assigned** from the
  Trigger Effect Monitor (Triggers tab) or re-loaded from its JSON file after flashing.
- **Hub-induced suspends.** A brief USB suspend caused by a flaky hub (while the host
  is awake) no longer powers off the controller. The power-off is debounced so only a
  sustained suspend — a real sleep or shutdown — powers the controller off; transient
  hub blips are ridden through. A deliberate "Reconnect USB" from the portal is also
  exempted, so saving settings that reconnect does not drop the controller.

## Building from source

Requires the Pico SDK (2.x) with the Pico 2W board support.

> **Important:** pin TinyUSB to 0.20.0 inside the SDK (`cd pico-sdk/lib/tinyusb && git checkout 0.20.0`). The SDK's bundled 0.18.0 fails to build the audio interface (`TUD_AUDIO_EP_SIZE`). Also run `git submodule update --init --recursive` so `lib/WDL` and `lib/opus` are present.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/awalol/DS5Dongle.git
cd DS5Dongle
git checkout v0.7.0
# apply the changes:
git apply /path/to/ds5dongle-v1.0.9.patch
# or copy the files from src/ over the originals

mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DPICO_SDK_PATH=/path/to/pico-sdk -DPICO_BOARD=pico2_w
make -j
```

The resulting `ds5-bridge.uf2` is the firmware.

## Credits & license

This is a derivative of **[awalol/DS5Dongle](https://github.com/awalol/DS5Dongle)**,
which in turn builds on earlier community work on the DualSense dongle concept.

**Auto-haptics origin — thanks to [@loteran](https://github.com/loteran).** The audio-derived auto-haptics in this
project were inspired by **[@loteran](https://github.com/loteran)'s** earlier auto-haptics experiments on the
DS5Dongle. The single most important insight came from loteran: relocating
`state_set` to RAM, which is what allows the haptic actuators to fire at stock clock
speeds (150 MHz) instead of requiring an overclock. The DSP and supporting code here
were rewritten from scratch (carrier modulation, channel detection, the noise gate,
the DS4Windows handling, the effect leak, and the config protocol are new), but
loteran's groundwork is what made the whole feature possible. This release would not
exist without it — thank you.

Thanks also to the broader DS5Dongle contributors and to awalol for the complete
RAM relocation in v0.7.0 that keeps native haptics and controller audio working
without overclocking, and for the wake-on-PS-button implementation. (**[@awalol](https://github.com/awalol)**)

**Upstream fixes incorporated.** The stuck-rumble fix is based on **mik9's** (GitHub handle to confirm) upstream
"Fix stuck rumble" commit. The USB suspend/wake hardening (debounced power-off to ride
out hub-induced suspends, plus the reconnect grace window) is based on
**[@up2urheadlights](https://github.com/up2urheadlights)'** upstream pull request [#186](https://github.com/awalol/DS5Dongle/pull/186). Both were adapted to the v0.7.0 base
used here. Thank you.

## Keeping up to date

**Watch releases, not commits.** Development happens as a steady stream of commits;
those are work in progress and aren't meant to be flashed. Every tested build is
published as a **release** with its own `.uf2`, portal and changelog entry. On
GitHub, *Watch* → *Custom* → *Releases* notifies you about those and nothing else.

**Updating is drag-and-drop.** Hold BOOTSEL while plugging the board in (or
triple-click BOOTSEL on a running one) and copy the new `.uf2` to the `RPI-RP2`
drive. Take the portal from the same release — the portal and firmware are released
together and are tested as a pair.

**Your settings survive.** Configuration and all saved profile slots carry across an
upgrade: new options are appended to the stored layout, so existing values keep
their meaning and anything new starts at its default. There is nothing to back up,
nothing to re-enter, and no need for `flash_nuke.uf2` unless a release note says so.

**How often is up to you.** There's no auto-update and nothing nags you. If your
setup works, staying on it is perfectly fine — upgrade when a release mentions a fix
or feature you actually want. Release notes say plainly when a change is
firmware-only, portal-only or documentation-only, so you can skip the ones that
don't affect you.

## Optional: Playnite automation

The `automation/` folder adds hands-off Playnite integration: it auto-applies a
profile per game and routes game audio to the dongle for audio-driven auto-haptics,
switching automatically between native-haptics games and everything else.

Need per-game configs to switch between? The **[Shared game profiles
page](https://artzox.github.io/DS5Dongle-Studio/profiles.html)** collects ready-to-import profiles — import one
into a slot and the automation can activate it per game.

Quick start:
1. **Python 3 — only if you play games *without* native DualSense support.** The
   automation starts the audio bridge for those games, and that needs Python. For
   any game listed in `native-games.txt` it applies the native profile and starts
   no audio capture, so **a native-only setup needs no Python** — slot switching,
   wake and per-game profiles all still work.
   - *Already installed it for audio routing in step 5 of the Quick start above?
     It's the same install — skip this and go to step 2.*
   - Otherwise install Python 3 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
     (tick *"Add python.exe to PATH"*), then `pip install PyAudioWPatch`.
     `numpy` is **optional** — it gives cleaner resampling, and is only *required*
     by the separate `ds5audio_downmix.py` helper.
2. Run `automation\ds5-setup.bat` — it detects its own folder and generates the
   Playnite scripts with correct paths, then prints the exact lines to paste into
   Playnite's script settings.
3. Run `automation\ds5-policy.bat` once (self-elevates). It pre-grants the dongle
   to the profile pages via browser policy, so automated applies never wait for a
   Connect click and the grant survives browser restarts. Fully reversible with
   `ds5-policy-remove.bat` (Edge/Chrome show "Managed by your organization" while
   the policy is installed).
4. To fill in your native-haptics game list, launch each such game once and copy
   the exact names from `ds5-automation.log` (each launch logs `game: '...'`) into
   `native-games.txt` — no need to type them from memory.
   Per-game custom profiles are supported too: save a profile into a dongle
   slot in the portal and add a `game = slot 3` rule to `profile-overrides.txt`
   (or the file-based form, `game = file.html`, for exported profiles).
5. See `automation\AUTOMATION-README.md` for the full walkthrough.

This is entirely optional — the firmware and config portal work on their own without
it. The automation just removes the manual steps if you use Playnite.

## Glossary

Terms used throughout this document and in the portal.

### Haptics and audio

**Actuator** — the voice coil in each grip of a DualSense. It replaces the
rumble motors of older pads and can reproduce audio-rate signals, which is why
haptics on this controller are delivered as sound rather than as motor speeds.

**Derived (auto-)haptics** — haptic feedback this firmware *generates* from game
audio, for games that have none of their own.

**Native haptics** — haptic feedback a game renders itself and sends to the
controller. Nothing is generated in that case; the firmware only passes it
through.

**Envelope** — how loud a signal is over time, ignoring the waveform itself.
The bass envelope of the game audio is what drives the derived haptics.

**Carrier** — a steady tone the envelope is applied to. The actuators cannot
render very low frequencies, so "how much bass" is turned into felt motion by
modulating a 90 Hz tone rather than sending the bass itself.

**Noise gate** — a threshold below which the derived haptics stay silent, so
room tone, dialogue and quiet music do not buzz continuously.

**LP cutoff (low-pass)** — the frequency above which content is discarded when
looking for bass. Lower = only deep rumble drives the haptics.

**Crossover / split** — dividing the audio into a low band and a high band so
each grip can be driven by a different part of the spectrum.

**Effect leak** — with the speaker muted, letting sharp one-off sounds (shots,
impacts, clinks) through to it anyway, while sustained dialogue and music stay
muted.

**Transient / onset** — a sudden jump in level, i.e. the start of a sound. What
the effect leak detects.

**Converted rumble** — a game's rumble instructions re-created on the actuators
as vibration, used when the actuators are busy with haptics and cannot be handed
to the controller's own rumble emulation.

**Motor values** — the two numbers a game sends to request rumble. Left is the
heavy/low-frequency motor, right the light/high-frequency one, a convention
inherited from pads that really had two different motors.

**ch0/1 and ch2/3** — the four audio channels the dongle receives. ch0/1 feed
the controller speaker and are what the derived haptics are generated from by
default; ch2/3 carry native haptics from a game that sends them.

**Native passthrough** — how much of ch2/3 is passed to the actuators in Mix
mode.

**Loopback capture** — recording what the PC is playing (rather than a
microphone), which is how `ds5audio.py` gets game audio to send to the dongle.

### Trigger effects

The DualSense triggers contain a motor and a clutch that can push back against
your finger at chosen points in the pull. The vocabulary below describes what
that mechanism is doing.

**Zone** — a position along the trigger pull, numbered 0 (released) to 9 (fully
pressed). Every trigger effect is defined by the zones it acts on.

**Resistance** — constant opposing force across a range of zones. Feels like the
trigger is stiffer, or like pulling through treacle.

**Wall** — a point in the pull where the trigger suddenly resists much harder,
so it feels like it has stopped. It may be a hard stop or something you can push
past with more force.

**Weapon break** — a wall you *do* push through, the way a real trigger breaks
when the sear releases: resistance builds, then gives way suddenly. Defined by
where it starts, where it gives, and how hard it holds.

**Bow** — tension that rises the further you pull, then snaps back when
released, like drawing and loosing a bowstring. Defined by a start and end zone
and two force levels.

**Vibration (trigger)** — a buzz felt in the trigger itself over a range of
zones, at a chosen frequency and strength. Used for engines, chainsaws,
automatic fire.

**Push-back kick (Stage 2)** — a short vibration burst fired while resistance is
engaged, so each shot knocks the trigger back against your finger before
resistance resumes. Its "bow-snap" variant uses the bow mechanism for a more
mechanical snap instead of a thump.

**R2T (Trigger-to-Rumble)** — rumble generated *from* how far you pull a
trigger, rather than sent by the game.

**Force Override** — take control of the triggers even while a game is sending
its own effects, instead of yielding to the game.

**Custom captured effect** — a real effect recorded from a game that has one,
stored as the exact bytes the game sent and replayed in a game that has none.

**Timeline capture** — recording not just an effect but its rhythm, so a
sequence of vibrations replays with the original timing.

### Device and connection

**Enumeration / re-enumeration** — the process where the PC discovers a USB
device and reads what it is. Settings that change the device's description
(wake, polling rate, audio buffer, mic/speaker) require the dongle to detach and
re-attach so the PC re-reads it, which briefly disconnects the controller.

**Idle identity** — the separate USB identity the dongle presents while the
controller is switched off and wake is enabled: *DS5Dongle (controller off)*,
with its own vendor and product IDs, so nothing appears to the PC as a
controller that is not connected.

**Remote wakeup** — the USB mechanism a device uses to wake a sleeping PC. It
needs the device to still be attached, and needs permission in Windows Device
Manager.

**Keyboard interface** — a second HID device the dongle presents to the PC
alongside the gamepad, used to send keystrokes. It is shared by Wake, the PS
button shortcut and Macros: it appears when any one of them is enabled and
disappears when none is. That appearing and disappearing is what re-enumerates
the controller, which is why enabling your *first* macro briefly disconnects the
pad but enabling a second one does not.

**Profile slot** — a complete configuration stored on the dongle itself, so
switching setups is one instant command rather than writing every setting.

**Passthrough mode (DS4Windows)** — DS4Windows forwarding a game's rumble to the
real controller rather than emulating a different pad.

### Macros

**Macro** — a controller input bound to a keyboard combination. The dongle sends
the keystrokes itself over its keyboard interface, so nothing runs on the PC and
it works in any application, not only games.

**Combo** — two or more buttons held together and treated as one trigger, such as
`R3 + D-pad Up`. A combo only fires once every one of its buttons is down, so
holding the first one on its own does nothing however long you hold it.

**Modifier** — Ctrl, Shift, Alt or the Windows key. Macros store modifiers in the
same list as ordinary keys rather than in a separate field, which is what allows
the order they are pressed and released to be recorded exactly as you performed
it.

**Release order** — which key of a combo lifts first. It matters more than it
sounds: Alt+Tab expects Tab to be released while Alt is still held. Recording
captures the real order; the **Pick** button assumes the usual one, last pressed
released first.

**Tap / long press** — whether a macro fires the moment the buttons go down, or
only after they have been held past a threshold. You set this by how long you
hold the buttons while recording rather than by typing a number.

**Swipe** — a touchpad gesture used as a macro trigger. Identified by its
direction, which half of the pad it starts on, and whether one or two fingers are
used, so a swipe recorded on the left half only fires when it starts there.

**Macro table** — the set of macro definitions, stored once on the dongle and
shared by every profile slot. Only *which* macros are enabled is stored per slot,
which is what lets one definition be live in one game and dormant in another.
